<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best first experience with the beginning of our house improvements. George and Anthony did an amazing job for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our specific requirements for our house. I will constantly use them and ask for George specifically for all future problems or repairs. They were prompt and offered great rates for what we needed done. I highly suggest this company for all your plumbing requires.</p>
<p>When the flush valve in the tank wears or fails out, another bothersome problem is. If you hear the toilet running constantly or regularly you most likely need the valve or float replaced.  Failing to repair a running toilet can result in lost water and an extremely high water costs. Water in Florida is expensive so do not postpone-- get a running toilet repaired. Fixing it may be best if your water heater is only a few years old and only has a small problem. You may want to think about repairing your water heater and scheduling routine maintenance if the cost of replacing broken parts is low-cost.</p>
