Atmos Energy does not preserve the gas lines on your property beyond our meter, this is the exact same as other utilities, such as your electrical circuitry and pipes.</p>
<p>Your first step is to shut off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5). If your valve is a various design from the one we show, examine the instructions. After installing the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
