<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Since water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily stored for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
