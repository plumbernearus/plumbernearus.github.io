Toilet-flushing is the single most water-intensive activity in many homes and represent over 30 percent of overall household water consumption. Toilets made before the 1980s might use up to seven gallons of water per flush (GPF.) Many are still on the task and still squandering water. Later on designs from the 1990s cut GPF in half.</p>

When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.

Backflow preventers are also required by the plumbing code. Other than within Coastline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities consumers is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County). The City of Coastline is the plumbing authority within Coastline's city limits. When it comes to backflow preventer requirements, Seattle Public Utilities works with both King County plumbing and the City of Coastline.</p>
<p>In addition to the specific facilities noted above, an approved backflow prevention assembly should be set up on each potable water service connection to any properties containing a prospective or actual danger. Noted below are examples of risks and the minimum security required to be installed for each kind of threat. The minimum accepted backflow prevention assembly for unlisted risks will be identified on a case-by-case basis by the Cross Connection Control Program.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you ultimately test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high danger" establishments.</p>
