<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high danger" establishments.</p>
