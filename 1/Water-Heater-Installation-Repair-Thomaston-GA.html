This is simply a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is essential to conquer the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming.

The usual use for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings ought to be gently lubricated to ensure they do not present of their retainer. Making use of excessive lubricant can cause the backflow prevention assembly to stop working or use out earlier by drawing in dirt and debris or restricting the motion of the component. The proper quantity of lubricant need to make the surface area of the 'ring appear wet. You ought to never ever see chunks or globs of lubricant.</p>
