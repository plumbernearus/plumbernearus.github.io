We extremely suggest repiping your home during spring or summer season so you do not have to worry about freezing temperature levels during the repiping process if you live in a cold-weather environment. Usually, if the issue is restricted to one sink or shower, drain cleaning is most likely the best option. When more than one drain is sluggish or clogged, it can show a bigger issue with your plumbing system.
