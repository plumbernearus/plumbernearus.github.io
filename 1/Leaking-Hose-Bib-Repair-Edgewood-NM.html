Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite.
