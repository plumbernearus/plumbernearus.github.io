The consumer has 30 days to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (inspect the due date on Notification of Requirements form). Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be needed to be located on the water service line, within the structure, or both areas. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a newly installed backflow preventer, the water customer is needed to have the backflow preventer evaluated on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the concern if this is the case. You might need to look into utilizing a high pressure water supply to get rid of the clog. This process is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the severity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
