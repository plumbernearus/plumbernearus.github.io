<p>Having hard water makes life ... well, hard. But you do not have to opt for spotty dishes and scratchy clothes. Including a water softener to your home implies gleaming dishes, cleaner laundry, shinier hair, and appliances that last and last. Plus, it can save you numerous dollars every year in energy costs alone.

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
