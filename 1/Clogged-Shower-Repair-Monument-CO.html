<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common. To eliminate the disposer, support it from listed below and turn the large, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise till the unit falls away.
