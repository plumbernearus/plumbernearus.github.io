This is specifically real when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change instructions to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
