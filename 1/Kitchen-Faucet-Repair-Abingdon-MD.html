<p>Those of us in the market understand that cross-connection programs in numerous locations have greatly reduced the variety of reported incidents that occur within our water supply. This has at times resulted in people thinking that backflow problems and problems no longer exist or that there might never ever actually have actually been a concern in the very first location. This thinking can be both disadvantageous and harmful. Backflow occurrences in water systems are an outcome of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a decreased pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far a lot of locations we have an all or nothing approach to backflow security. We need to take a look at each installation for the danger it presents and after that install the appropriate protection.</p>
