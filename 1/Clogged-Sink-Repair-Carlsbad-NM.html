<p>Trees and shrubs are a common reason for sewer obstructions to the house. Roots can grow into the tiniest crack or gap in your home's drain pipe, where they thrive in the nutrient rich environment supplied by the sewer. Flat roofings usually have drains spaced out around their perimeter. The drains are linked to vertical pipes that are typically linked to underground horizontal pipes linked to community storm sewers. Roto-Rooter can mechanically clean these drains from one end to the other to restore flow and prevent water collection on top of the structure's roof.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most apparent indications of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a larger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Regardless of whether it is an electric water heater or a gas water heater, Premier Plumbing has supplied hot water heater repair and installation service in the Hampton Roads area since 1978.</p>
