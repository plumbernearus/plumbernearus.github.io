<p>Leakages are sneaky. While the time needed will differ based upon your house size and the number of found malfunctions, it's best to set aside approximately 2 hours when you arrange an inspection. There's constantly the opportunity that your plumber's previous job will run long and postpone the beginning time. If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next visit, they likely rushed the task (unless you have an extremely small plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection generally takes when you call to schedule your consultation.</p>
