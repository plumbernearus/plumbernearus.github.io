<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly.
