To eliminate the disposer, support it from listed below and rotate the big, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise up until the unit falls away.

<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if required, to place the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the store if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation set consists of a tube, or purchase one individually at the very same time for about $3.</p>
<p>Hard water, particles from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can avoid a flush valve from closing completely. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the debris. Images 1 and 2 reveal you how to do this on one typical type of valve. Even though other valves will look different, the clearing process is comparable. Nevertheless, you may have to eliminate a few screws on top of the fill valve to eliminate the cap.</p>
