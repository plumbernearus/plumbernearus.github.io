When the tank leaks, your water heater is dead. The dead giveaway that your water heater needs changing is a sluggish drip underneath, normally appearing as a trail of rusty water. This means that the steel tank has rusted through and can't be fixed. Other signs, such as insufficient or no hot water, usually signal other hot water heater repair problems that you can fix.</p>
