There's always the chance that your plumber's previous job will run long and delay the starting time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely rushed the task (unless you have a really small plumbing system). When you call to schedule your visit, ask for how long the inspection usually takes.</p>

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that need to also be well preserved to help avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and break or simply be so squished that it does not fill the space in addition to it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the location.
