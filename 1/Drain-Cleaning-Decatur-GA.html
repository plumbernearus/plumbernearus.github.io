<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that need to also be well preserved to help avoid leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and break or simply be so squished that it does not fill the space in addition to it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the location.
