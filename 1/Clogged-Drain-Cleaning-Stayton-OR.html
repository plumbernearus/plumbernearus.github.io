<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in Stayton OR</h3>
<p>Try to find a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can take place when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will stream backwards into the city water lines since pressure is lost during these occasions.</p>
