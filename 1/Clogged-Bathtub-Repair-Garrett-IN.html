<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt when newly regrowed. As hard water passes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Tough water triggers white or gray deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be used to minimize these signs.</p>
