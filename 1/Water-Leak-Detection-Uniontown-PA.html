<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system should be continuously kept track of.

This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>

At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
