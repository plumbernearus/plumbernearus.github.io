<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly stored for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
