<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. When you ultimately check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
