<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange install) enough to push the call a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange).

The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
