The repair specialist has a long list of things he should find out to be able to repair a backflow prevention assembly and return it to its original factory specifications.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to turn off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a various style from the one we show, inspect the directions. After installing the valve (Picture 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>

<p>Any gas line installation or repair needs a permit before any work can be done.

And that's where a backflow prevention system is available in helpful. Let's take a better take a look at how a backflow prevention system works.</p>
