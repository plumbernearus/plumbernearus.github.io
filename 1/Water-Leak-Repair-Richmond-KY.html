<p>To help avoid obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than utilize the technique set out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up because the baffle successfully halves the interior diameter of the tee. When the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is specifically real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
