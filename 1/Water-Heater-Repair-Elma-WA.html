Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
