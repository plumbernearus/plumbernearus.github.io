I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
