The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite circulation is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a total breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that allows water to leave.
