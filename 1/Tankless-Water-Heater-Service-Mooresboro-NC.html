<p>Try to find a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Turn off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, turn off the breaker.) Eliminate the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Water is no longer being pressed forward into your home and will flow backwards into the city water lines since pressure is lost during these events.</p>
