<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
