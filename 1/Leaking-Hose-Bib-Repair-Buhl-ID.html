<p>To help prevent obstructions within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the approach laid out above. Because the baffle effectively halves the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is particularly true.

In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
