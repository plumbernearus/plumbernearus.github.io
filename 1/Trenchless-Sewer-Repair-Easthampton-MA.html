<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Easthampton MA</h3>
<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
<p>A water firmness test would not show a reduced hardness. How do I know it's working? The FutureSoft is a salt-free system that does not take out the solidity to replace them with sodium.
