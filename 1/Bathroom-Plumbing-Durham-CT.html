<p>Try to find a jam. Something too tough to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then disconnect the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for usage. Because pressure is lost during these occasions, water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will stream in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
