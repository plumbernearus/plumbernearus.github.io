<p>When you remove the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Changing a bad washer is inexpensive and easy. However finding the ideal washer might not be. The most common washers are often available in your home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be difficult to discover. Remove it and take it to the store to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers usually replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
