<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly constant, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly saved for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
