A backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from flowing back to the City system if pressure is lost. Backflow can infect the water system. The fundamental system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which offers a physical barrier to backflow.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers need to only be repaired when the information collected from the field test indicates the assembly has deteriorated in its efficiency listed below the established minimum standard. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if needed, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
