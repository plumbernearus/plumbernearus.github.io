<p>6 - The eluate, which is the wastewater from the regeneration procedure, streams from the regrowed filter via the eluate degasifier (5) to a tank (6 ). Approx. 40% of the eluate is re-used for the next regrowth cycle. Prior to we ever start the repiping process, we will discuss the materials to be used, the work that will be carried out, and the costs of the procedure. We will also discuss to you any work that we will contract out to a contractor who will refinish your walls.</p>
