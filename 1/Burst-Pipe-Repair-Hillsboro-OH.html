Rusty pipes also result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Standpipe systems are used in many centers, these systems are designed to supply water to fire hose connections or hose cabinets strategically installed inside a structure.

Standpipe systems can offer early fire suppression in these buildings making it capable for a single person or firemen to provide a effective and fast action to fire. There are 2 types of standpipe systems, the very first type, are dry systems, which generally include no permanent water supply and are pressurized through a fire department connection by fire workers reacting to an event. A dry standpipe system needs no backflow prevention defense.
