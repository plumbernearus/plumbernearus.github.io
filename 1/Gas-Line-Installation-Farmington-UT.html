<p>Your primary step is to shut down the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5). Examine the instructions if your valve is a various style from the one we show. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
