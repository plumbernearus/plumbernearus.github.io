It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental operational usage, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain along with avoiding back siphonage.
