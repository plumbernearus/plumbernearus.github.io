<p>To assist prevent obstructions within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the approach laid out above. Due to the fact that the baffle successfully halves the interior size of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially true when the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
