If you notice low water pressure or tarnished water, it generally signifies rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals build up gradually, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you might see lower water pressure. The staining takes place when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and circulation into your water system, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health threat in your water.</p>
