If your home was built before the 1970s, we highly advise that you employ a plumbing professional to check your home's plumbing and examine if there are areas that need repiping. Opportunities are that your home may need extensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can function at ideal rates if your home was developed decades before that.</p>
