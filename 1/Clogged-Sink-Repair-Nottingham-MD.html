<p>This ion exchange process is helped with by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with salt ions. This is another combination that can work on sink blockages. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mix sit for several hours, then flush with boiling water. You can duplicate this process if it does not work the first time. We do hot water heaters installations and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
<p>An rdc is similar to a DC in that it is a mechanical backflow preventer consisting of two separately acting, spring-loaded check valves. However, it normally does not consist of shutoff valves, may or may not be geared up with test dicks or ports, and is usually less reliable than a DC. An rdc works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage however should be utilized to isolate only nonhealth hazards and is meant for use just in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>
<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water travels through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent out to drain. This process continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered fully regrowed.</p>
