<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Lewes DE</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system should be continually monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
