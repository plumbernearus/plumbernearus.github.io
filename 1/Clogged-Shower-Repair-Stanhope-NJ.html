<p>An Innovative solution allowing Utilities to proactively monitor their water networks, trace leaks and identify their exact places while utilizing highly delicate acoustic sensing units, management software application & mobile applications. Water softening is the elimination of calcium, magnesium, and certain other metal cations in difficult water The resulting soft water requires less soap for the very same cleaning effort, as soap is not wasted bonding with calcium ions. Soft water also extends the life time of plumbing by eliminating or lowering scale accumulation in fittings and pipes. Water softening is usually achieved using lime softening or ion-exchange resins but is increasingly being achieved utilizing nanofiltration or reverse osmosis membranes.</p>
<p>The usual solution is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced: whole-house repiping. This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older home (built pre-1970) or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately experiences corrosion and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>This 3-stage water treatment system with a stainless steel filter media tank will filter and soften your water for many years to come.

Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond should be checked upon installation and then every year.</p>

<p>The home still had lead pipes. Residences built in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes.
