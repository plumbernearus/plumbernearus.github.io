<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Hamilton MI?</h3>
<p>Read your insurance policy completely if your polybutylene pipes have actually stopped working. Make sure you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurance provider will not cover a slow leak. Claims may be denied because the standard HO-3 homeowners' policy particularly excludes "a loss as the result of a water leak over a prolonged amount of time." Call your insurance agent and verify your protection. Double check with your agent to confirm that your understanding is correct as soon as you have read through your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered.</p>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing blockage service may look like a waste of money. Why invest in professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will work? While chemical drain cleaners might be a low-cost option, the severe components corrode your inner drain pipe, in time, creating weak points in the pipe that are likely to burst. Handling repairing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the savings sustained from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Any sewer-related checks will require a camera inspection. For a sewer camera inspection, a camera can be put down the drain in a sink to inspect the pipes in the house, or an outdoor pipe to check the sewer main in the backyard. Sewer cameras can go hundreds of feet into the pipe, so they can be used to scope the main line. The camera will send a signal when it discovers the clog, informing the inspector the specific place.
