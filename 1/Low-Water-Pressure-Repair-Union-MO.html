<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
