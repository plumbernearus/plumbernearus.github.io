Exists anything even worse than a toilet clog? Somebody might have flushed something they shouldn't have down the toilet or your pipes have built-up residue and need cleaning.

<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is warmed directly whenever it's required. Tankless systems specifically use an element that heats up water when the tap is turned on. The water is continually warmed as long as the tap remains on. If the tap is right away turned off, the water stops being heated up. The heating temperature is typically pre-set to suit your needs and preferences. Because they just heat water when needed, tankless electric water heaters use less power than traditional water heaters.</p>
