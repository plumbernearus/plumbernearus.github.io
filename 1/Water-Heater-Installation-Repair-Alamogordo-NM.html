<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Given that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily saved for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
