We highly recommend repiping your house during spring or summertime so you do not have to stress about freezing temperature levels throughout the repiping process if you live in a cold-weather environment.

<p>IRWD is devoted to providing safe, high quality water to customers. Our extensive water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water provided to our customers is kept free from harmful contaminants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to equipment including a nonpotable compound, this is known as a cross-connection. Contamination may happen when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating & cooling system, into the safe and clean water supply. This can occur through a procedure called backflow.</p>
