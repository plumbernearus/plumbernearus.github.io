<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes in Chatham IL</h3>
<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
