Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a few things differently might have saved her a lot of money. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>

A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the clog with unfavorable pressure, it actually presses into the obstruction, working even more into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip helps force it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
