<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that impact. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten up the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.
