I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
