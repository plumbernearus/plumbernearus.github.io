<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds.

As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly saved for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
