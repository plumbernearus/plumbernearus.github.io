<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a threat to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Dinuba CA</h3>
<p>Sodium consumption from softened water can be avoided by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. If health or ecological factors demand restricting salt, substituting potassium chloride for sodium chloride might be appropriate. Over time, the beads become covered with minerals and have to be cleaned up. This cleaning procedure, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: rinse, backwash and recharge. The regeneration process can be scheduled instantly with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
<p>I wanted to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the very best 1st experience with the beginning of our house improvements. George and Anthony did an amazing job for us. They exceeded and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our specific requirements for our home. I will always use them and request George particularly for all future problems or repairs. They were prompt and provided very good pricing for what we required done. I highly recommend this company for all your plumbing requires.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems utilize UV light to ruin micro-organisms and supply cleansed water. The energy source needed to warm the water is less expensive. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that cause water solidity can be removed fairly easily by utilizing an ion exchange treatment. Standard water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations refer to positively charged ions dissolved in the water. Cation exchange involves the replacement of the hardness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>During the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this brine passes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This process continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about completely regrowed.</p>
