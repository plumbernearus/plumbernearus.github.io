In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and eliminated. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to remove any leftover contaminants.</p>
