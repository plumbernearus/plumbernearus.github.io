<p>To assist avoid obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of utilize the technique set out above. Since the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is specifically true when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
