The riser needs to be strongly attached to strong rebar or wooden stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection in between the water meter and the structure plumbing prior to the structure is substantially complete is restricted unless a double check backflow assembly is installed and right away evaluated to ensure it is working.</p>
