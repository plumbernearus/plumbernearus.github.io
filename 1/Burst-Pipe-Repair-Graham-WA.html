<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Graham WA</h3>
<p>Natural Gas and gas that comes out of the ground is totally odor-free. The egg odor associated with gas is a chemical blended into it so that we can smell it. If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are security preventative measures you need to take to protect yourself, your household and your home. Some jurisdictions likewise permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
