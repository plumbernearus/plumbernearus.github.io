<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily kept for later usage when need rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
