<p>The double check assembly was developed in the 1950s for the fire protection market, producing a redundancy designed to guarantee that a person check valve will continue to protect the city supply of water even if the other stops working. This assembly likewise enables the closure of one valve to lower the pressure differential across the other, creating a more reliable seal and preventing even small backflow leakage. Test dicks, or small ball valves, enable the accessory of testing equipment that assesses whether the check assembly is functional.</p>
<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily saved for later usage when need rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
