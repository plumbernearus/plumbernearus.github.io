<p>Salt-free systems will also lower scale buildup and offer brighter clothes and softer skin using a healthier technique. The main benefit with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without needing to add salt to the water. This is a more heart ecologically friendly and healthy system. Standard salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have a negative impact on people with high-blood pressure and heart problem.

Salt-free softeners are also known as water conditioners since they do not in fact soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it.
