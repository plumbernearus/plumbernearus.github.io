Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
