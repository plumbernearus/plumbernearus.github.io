<p>Most toilets used today operate with a standard gravity flushing style, suggesting they utilize the force of the gravity to push the clean water into the bowl and after that on into the sewage system. Just recently, however, toilets using a vacuum flushing system have actually been appearing in more and more homes. This system uses a vacuum-assisted flushing mechanism to draw the water into the bowl and down into the sewage systems. A disadvantage of this device is that it's much more hard to unclog your toilet were to end up being clogged.</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper mount ring (flange install) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
