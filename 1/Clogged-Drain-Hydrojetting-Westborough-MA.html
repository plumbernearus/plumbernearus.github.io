<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- destructive.

Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of corrosion A softener is just catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
