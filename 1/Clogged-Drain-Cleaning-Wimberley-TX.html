<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
