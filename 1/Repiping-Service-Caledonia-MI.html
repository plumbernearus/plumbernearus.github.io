<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
