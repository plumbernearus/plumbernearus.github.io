If pushing down on the flapper stops the noise, the flapper isn't sealing under typical pressure. Switch off the water, flush the toilet to empty the tank and after that run your finger around the rim of the flush valve seat. Clean the flush valve seat with an abrasive sponge or ScotchBrite pad if you feel mineral deposits. Do not use anything that might roughen it. If cleaning the flush valve seat does not fix the problem, you need to replace the flapper.</p>
<p>However, this cost can as much as double when streets, utilities, driveways or sidewalks lie above the broken pipe. Displacing or restoring these ground-level components can run conventional pipe repair costs as high as $25,000, if not more, for a single job. In these instances, the cost of trenchless stays the same; as digging is no longer necessary, trenchless specialists can fully repair or replace your damaged pipe without unnecessarily digging an inch of soil.</p>
