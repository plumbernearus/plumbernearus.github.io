<p>Backflow is bad news. Secure the drain hose. The water softener requires to drain the diminished brine service after the regeneration cycle. Secure the drain hose securely and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain tubes should have an air space.
