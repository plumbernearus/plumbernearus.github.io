Possibly there is a fracture in the sink's basin and you've discovered a little leak. In any of these cases, it's best to have plumbing experts replace your sink so you understand you're getting the greatest quality work. The systems last nearly twice as long as water tanks.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
