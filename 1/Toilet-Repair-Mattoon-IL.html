I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
