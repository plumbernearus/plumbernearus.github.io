These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately constant, use never ever exactly matches supply.
