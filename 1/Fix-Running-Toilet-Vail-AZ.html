<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure used to purify water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three stages. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while liquified solids are caught and removed. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to get rid of any leftover pollutants.</p>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is just capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (generally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
