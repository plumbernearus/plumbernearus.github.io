<p>To help avoid clogs within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the method set out above.

When the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is especially real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free.
