<p>Standpipe systems are utilized in many centers, these systems are designed to provide water to fire hose connections or hose cabinets strategically set up inside a building. These systems normally are installed in big, open spaces within buildings, and in multistory buildings for the purpose of manual firefighting. Standpipe systems can provide early fire suppression in these buildings making it capable for a single person or firefighter to use a efficient and quick response to fire. There are two kinds of standpipe systems, the very first type, are dry systems, which typically contain no irreversible supply of water and are pressurized through a fire department connection by fire workers reacting to an event.
