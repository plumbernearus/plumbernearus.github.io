In a lot of circumstances, you will find that repairs that need to be made will be made in order to get the home off the marketplace.

<p>Our process begins with an inspection of the different problems dealt with by the homeowner, this is followed by one of our substantial group of technicians placing a camera into the drains to identify the blocked area and identify how best to continue.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
