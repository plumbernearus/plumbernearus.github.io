<h3>Water Heater Leaking in Manor TX? The Way to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
