<p>To help prevent clogs within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the technique set out above.

This is especially true when the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change instructions to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
