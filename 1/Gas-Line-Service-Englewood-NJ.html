<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Englewood NJ?</h3>
<p>If your polybutylene pipes have actually stopped working, read your insurance policy thoroughly. Make sure you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Numerous insurance companies will not cover a slow leak. Claims may be denied because the basic HO-3 house owners' policy specifically leaves out "a loss as the result of a water leak over a prolonged amount of time." Call your insurance representative and confirm your coverage. Double check with your agent to verify that your understanding is right when you have actually checked out through your policy and confirmed what is covered and what is not covered.</p>

<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin has already been fouled. Again, it is advisable to inspect the manufacturer's guidelines for unique preventative measures.</p>
