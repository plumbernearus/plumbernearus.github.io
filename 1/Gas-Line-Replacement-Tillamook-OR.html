<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water circulation, occurs. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's supply of water movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of close-by soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to escape. In some cases no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose shut down lead to a significant pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
