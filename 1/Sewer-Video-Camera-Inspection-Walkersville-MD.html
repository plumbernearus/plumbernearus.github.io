<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact in between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
