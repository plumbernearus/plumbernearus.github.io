<p>A water heater installation is not the repair on which to sharpen your plumbing skills if you're reasonably unskilled. So save yourself some major trouble by being honest with yourself about where your experience level is. Many backflow preventers are created to allow the parts to be eliminated for repair while the main body stays installed in the piping system.

Understanding the proper order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
