<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
