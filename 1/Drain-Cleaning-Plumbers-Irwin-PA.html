<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Irwin PA</h3>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
