<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Typically, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
