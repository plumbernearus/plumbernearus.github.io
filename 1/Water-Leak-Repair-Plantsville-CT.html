This creates a backflow condition and the capacity for infected water getting in the drinkable water circulation system. Copper is a biostatic material, which indicates bacteria will not grow on it.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
