This has at times led to people thinking that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there might never actually have been a concern in the very first place. This thinking can be both hazardous and detrimental. Backflow occurrences in water supply are an outcome of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a lowered pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far a lot of locations we have an all or nothing approach to backflow security. We need to look at each installation for the risk it provides and after that install the proper protection.</p>
