Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the office number noted on the structure permit. Inspections need to be made after foundation excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to hiding work), and upon conclusion. KEEP IN MIND: If defective work is discovered, the inspector will issue an infraction notification, and a particular period of time is allotted to fix the problem.</p>
