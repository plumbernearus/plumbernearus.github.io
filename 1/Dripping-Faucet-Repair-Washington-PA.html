<p>Potassium chloride is more expensive and adheres more strongly to the resin, minimizing the exchange effectiveness when compared to salt chloride. About 10 percent more potassium chloride salt is used throughout the backflush operation. What we suggest is that your toilet is old. Older toilets may work simply great, however if your toilet is truly old (and outdated in design), you might want to think about a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing.

In some models, test dicks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>
