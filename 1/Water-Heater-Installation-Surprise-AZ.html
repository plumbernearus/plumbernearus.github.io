<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
