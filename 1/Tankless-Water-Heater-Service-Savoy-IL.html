Sluggish drains: If you observe that your drains are clearing slower, it could be a sign of the early stages of a clog.

While this might work in the short term, keep in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the exact same product as other pipes in your home, implying that difficulty could be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you comfort and avoid larger leaks down the roadway.</p>
