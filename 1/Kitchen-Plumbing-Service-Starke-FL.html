<p>Sediment Accumulation: If you notice unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your system, this could be an indicator that sediment has built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating component. Running out of hot water rapidly is another sign of sediment accumulation, due to the fact that the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
