<p>Will sears install my garbage disposal for me. The simplest backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is essential to overcome the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simpleness of its style and absence of moving parts. Nevertheless, it might be impractical in many scenarios to install a pipe segment of this length. Moreover, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
