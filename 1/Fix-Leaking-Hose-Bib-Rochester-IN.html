The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite flow is typically localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that allows water to get away.
