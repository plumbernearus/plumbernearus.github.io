<p>A recently set up water heater must not produce weird noises, but it will begin to produce rumbling noises as it ages. The sounds get louder over time as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things worsen significantly for families with a high demand for warm water. The reasons for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to restore normalcy. A water heater replacement might be required if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
