<p>A. Utilizing phosphoric acid typically will help eliminate them if you have rust spots. If you wish to attempt the gentlest method perhaps attempt using some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Wipe with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not do the trick then utilize Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and security warnings first!).
