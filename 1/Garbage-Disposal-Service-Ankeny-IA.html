Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
