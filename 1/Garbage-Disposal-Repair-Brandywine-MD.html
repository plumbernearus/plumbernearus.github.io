<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Toilet performance- The higher the performance of the toilet, the more it costs. The effectiveness of your toilet is measured in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more efficient your toilet is. Learn if there are any lead pipes in the house. Homes that were developed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how helpful, is an ecological contaminant (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in homes that is not lead based). You might not desire to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
