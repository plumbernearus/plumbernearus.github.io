I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
