Big Blue Plumbing can purchase and handle the permit process. Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that go through fouling, use or tiredness. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. Therefore, all backflow preventers have to be evaluated periodically to ensure they are working correctly. A visual check of air gaps suffices, but mechanical backflow preventers have to be checked with properly adjusted gauge equipment.</p>
