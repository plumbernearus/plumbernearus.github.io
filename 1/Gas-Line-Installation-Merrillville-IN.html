<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin has already been fouled. Again, it is a good idea to inspect the producer's guidelines for unique precautions.</p>
<p>The function of the Info Inspection (authorization) is to have the plumbing contractor meet an inspector at the task site to review a proposed installation, which might not remain in conformance with the code. The proposal to deviate from the code is sent in duplicate, in composing or with clear illustrations, and mentions the factor for deviation. The proposal may be thought about and authorized, if it satisfies the intent of the plumbing code.</p>
