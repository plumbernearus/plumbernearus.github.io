<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver lady thought the price she paid for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was excessive. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a couple of things in a different way might have conserved her a lot of cash. For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, decreased or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>Line up the rubber seal ring on the top of the disposer with the flange beneath the sink. Press it into place, and loosely secure it by turning the lower mounting ring onto the ramp tabs of the upper mounting ring. Rotate disposer unit as needed to align drain assembly. There's a nasty odor coming from your drains - You might not see this right now, but nasty smells indicate whatever is stuck in your drains-- likely food waste-- is rotting in there.
