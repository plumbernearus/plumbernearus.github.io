<p>So, how does a softener know when to get down to organisation? The timing of regeneration depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of an established schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, regardless of whether the water actually needs it. When needed, more recent systems use digital sensing units that keep track of bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water usage and for that reason only regenerate. These newer systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect since they save energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
