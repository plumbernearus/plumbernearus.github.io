<p>Garbage disposals are developed to work in one of two methods. Either through what's referred to as a batch feed, where the system is filled, then covered prior to it is switched on, or through a continuous feed, where the unit can be filled while it is running. An authorized backflow prevention device, which must be tested annually, should be set up on the service connection that the department has determined as having a potential for backflow.

<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
