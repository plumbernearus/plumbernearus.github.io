Age-- As we mentioned, a 10+ years of age hot water heater is most likely on its last legs. If you are unsure how old your system is, you should be able to get that information from the serial number on the producer's sticker label (typically near the top of the system). Normally, the first two numbers indicate the year of your hot water heater.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>
<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
