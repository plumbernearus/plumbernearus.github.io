<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Portland OR</h3>
<p>While city water does get treated, it is done for purposes of getting rid of bacterial problems and making the water drinkable. These are certainly concerns for a town and its residents however tough water can adversely affect faucets and appliances in a house.

A clogged drain can even lead to sluggish water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and pricey repairs.</p>
