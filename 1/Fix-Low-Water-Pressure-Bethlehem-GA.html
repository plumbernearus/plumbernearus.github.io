<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
