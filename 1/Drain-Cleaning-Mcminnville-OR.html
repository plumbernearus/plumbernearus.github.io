In a different drain path, small pipes run from the tub and sink to eventually meet up with a bigger one underneath the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the house. A terrific method to reduce the quantity of food waste in your kitchen is to install a garbage disposal. Rapidly and effectively eliminating remaining potato peels, fruit rinds and numerous other kinds of food waste, the disposal grinds it all into great particles that are flushed out of the chamber and into the house drainage, waste and vent system or what you probably call your sewer.</p>
