<p>Will sears install my waste disposal unit for me. The most basic backflow prevention device is the barometric loop. This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the supply of water pipeline. The height is necessary to get rid of the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its advantages are the simpleness of its design and lack of moving parts. However, it may be unwise in lots of situations to install a pipe sector of this length. Additionally, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the result of a pump failure.</p>
