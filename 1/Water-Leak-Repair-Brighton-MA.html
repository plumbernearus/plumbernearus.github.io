<h3>Water Heater Leaking in Brighton MA? The Way to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>Try to find a jam. Something too difficult to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, switch off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Since pressure is lost throughout these occasions, water is no longer being pushed forward into your home and will stream in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
