<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Rensselaer IN</h3>
<p>If your polybutylene pipes have actually failed, read your insurance policy thoroughly. Make certain you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Many insurance provider will not cover a slow leak. Claims may be rejected because the standard HO-3 homeowners' policy specifically excludes "a loss as the result of a water leak over an extended amount of time." Call your insurance coverage agent and confirm your coverage. Double check with your agent to verify that your understanding is appropriate when you have read through your policy and verified what is covered and what is not covered.</p>

<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to press the call a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new system.</p>
