The system should grind the waste even finer to avoid blockages and allow the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields.

This procedure continues until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about totally regrowed.</p>
