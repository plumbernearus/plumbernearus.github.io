Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.

<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Draper UT</h3>
<p>A common water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line.

From new bathroom fixtures to custom-made countertops, we genuinely have it all. Our stock makes us the best plumbing company for any task in Seattle, WA.
