<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Bristol PA</h3>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to hire a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair costs may be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the brand-new heater. To make sure that we are offering premium work and customer assurance, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and completely trained to safely perform water heater replacements. In addition to traditional hot water heater, we also install tankless hot water heater, and heat pump water heaters.</p>
<p>Malfunctioning parts: If you have an electric hot water heater, a defective thermostat or a tripped breaker can cause problems. If you have a gas system, the pilot burner might head out, leading to little or no hot water. In basic, traditional hot water heater are anticipated to last 7-10 years with appropriate maintenance. If you're moving into a new house, examine the age of the existing water heater. You don't want to move into a new house only to find out you're going to need to make a major plumbing repair in just a year or more.</p>
