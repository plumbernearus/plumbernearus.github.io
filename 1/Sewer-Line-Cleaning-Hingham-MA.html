<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you ultimately check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
