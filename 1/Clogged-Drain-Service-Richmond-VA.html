<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Richmond VA</h3>
<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. happens when there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system motion. This opposite flow is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to vehicle traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from nearby heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on. The result is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to leave. In some cases no evident physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose shut down results in a considerable pressure drop across the pipe network.</p>
