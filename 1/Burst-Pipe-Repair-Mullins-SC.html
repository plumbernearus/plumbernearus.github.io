That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high threat" establishments.</p>
