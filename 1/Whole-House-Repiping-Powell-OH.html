Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
