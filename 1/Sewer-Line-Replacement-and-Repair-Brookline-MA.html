However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. The majority of house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet.
