<p>To help prevent obstructions within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the method set out above. Since the baffle effectively halves the interior size of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is especially real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
