Low or unbalanced water pressure is typically a result of corroded metal pipes. When deterioration builds up inside of your pipes, water output for showers, sinks, and other components is significantly minimized.</p>
<p>This ion exchange process is assisted in by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with sodium ions. This is another combination that can work on sink obstructions. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mixture sit for a number of hours, then flush with boiling water. If it doesn't work the first time, you can duplicate this procedure. We do hot water heaters setups and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>

Unbreakable Blockages: Professional help is the best treatment, if you discover yourself provided with a particularly persistent clog.

We advise installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to signal you of any possible gas leakages if you have not done so already.</p>
