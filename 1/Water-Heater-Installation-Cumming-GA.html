<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged sodium ions.

The water streams through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
