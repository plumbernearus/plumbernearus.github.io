<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
