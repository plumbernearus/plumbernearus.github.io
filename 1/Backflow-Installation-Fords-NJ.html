<p>Search for a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, might be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most simply raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers.
