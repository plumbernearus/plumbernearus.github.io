<p>SofTap's water softening technology is well-suited for household, commercial, and commercial applications, including the prevention of limescale accumulation in families and scaling in commercial water treatment systems, in addition to improving present reverse osmosis treatment systems. The technology is simpler and more affordable than other softening systems on the market today that use zeolites, which need to be restored using brine, or membrane nanofiltration that requires substantial water usage and high pressure.</p>

A water producing company only has to add a water softener in its water purification system, to produce softened water inexpensively. Without an expert having inspected your pipes, it can be challenging to know if repiping is the best response.
