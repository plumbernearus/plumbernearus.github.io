The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system motion. This opposite circulation is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying streets, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The result is a complete breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that allows water to get away. Often no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose shut down lead to a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
