<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
