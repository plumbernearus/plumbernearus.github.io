<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a process called ion exchange to remove difficult water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical procedure known as Template Assisted Condensation (TAC).

Salt-free softeners are also known as water conditioners since they do not actually soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it. And due to the fact that these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to get rid of recorded ions.</p>
