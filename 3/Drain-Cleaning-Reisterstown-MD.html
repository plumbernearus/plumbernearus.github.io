<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of home centers carry just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close.
