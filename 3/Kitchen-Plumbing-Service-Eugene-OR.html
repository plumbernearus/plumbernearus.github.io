<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly restored, the beads end up being loaded with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the difficult water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your use. When water is heated up, tough water triggers gray or white deposits. Water softening can be utilized to lower these signs.</p>
