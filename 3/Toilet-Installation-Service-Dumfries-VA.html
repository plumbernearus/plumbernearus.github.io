You should also decrease the tee that the discharge pipe links to if the brand-new unit's outlet is lower. Loosen the 2 nuts that connect the tee to the tailpiece above and the trap listed below.

<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Dumfries VA</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it ought to be much less water.</p>
