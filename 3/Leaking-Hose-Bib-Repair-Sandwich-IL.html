<p>An air pressure test is required. The test pressure will be at least 1 1/2 times the working pressure, but no less than 3 pounds per square inch (psi).

Mechanical determines utilized to determine test pressures will have a range such that the greatest end of the scale is not higher than 5 times the test pressure.

The piping system will be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge visible at the time of inspection. Where the gauge does not show the minimum pressure required for the test, or any reduction of test pressures as shown by pressure assesses during inspection shall be deemed to suggest the existence of a leak.</p>
