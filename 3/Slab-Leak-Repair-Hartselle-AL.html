While there's not an exact timetable as to when you need to repipe your home, you must absolutely look into repiping if they have not been carried out in 50 years or more-- especially if you reside in an older home built closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our ac unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech discuss exactly what was incorrect with the system, how he repaired the problem, and how to prevent a reaccuance. I would highly recommend Hunter for any concerns you might have.</p>

Brooks discovered just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
