<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the very best 1st experience with the start of our home improvements. George and Anthony did a remarkable job for us. They exceeded and beyond any expectations that we had. They likewise worked around our specific requirements for our house. I will always utilize them and request George particularly for all future concerns or repairs. They were timely and provided great prices for what we needed done.

<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange install) enough to press the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from sliding off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
<p>Things Pushed in Disposal. From silverware to big pieces of food, items frequently get jammed in the garbage disposal. With soapy water covering the disposal, in some cases it can be challenging to see what gets captured. Never ever try to remove the things or it will get stuck even further. Contact Winters House Services immediately to adequately get rid of the things. Excavation: If the pipe is challenging to gain access to, it can cost $1,000 to $5,000 to get to the leak due to excavation expenses.</p>
