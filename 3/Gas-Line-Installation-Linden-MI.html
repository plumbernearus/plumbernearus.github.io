<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver woman thought the price she spent for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things differently might have conserved her a lot of cash. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and trigger a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>There are two types of disposals: batch feed and continuous feed. The majority of homes use continuous feed disposals, which indicates the disposal will work as long as it is switched on. This comes in handy when a great deal of work is to be done in the kitchen. Batch disposals have a holding tank that collects waste until it is complete and is then triggered when the cover is closed. Our plumbers can assist you choose which type of disposal will work best for your sink.</p>
