<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The 2 indications of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect over time, they gradually start to constrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a long time for this much accumulation to happen, so by the time you observe it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, impacting your water quality.</p>
