Bear in mind that the majority of plumbing problems are easy for a professional to fix when they are caught in a timely fashion. Make a visit to have a plumber diagnose the problem if you are experiencing any of the above signs in your household. The sooner you fix plumbing problems, the less expensive the repairs.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to shut off the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a various design from the one we show, examine the directions. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
