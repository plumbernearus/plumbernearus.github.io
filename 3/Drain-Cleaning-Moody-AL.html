<p>Lubrication may aid with the positioning of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any much better, it is just there to help the service technician put together the components into the body without developing damage from friction. The lube must be a food grade lubricant to guarantee the water supply is not polluted. In most cases the very best lube is water. The usual usage for lubricant in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings must be gently oiled to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. Using too much lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to fail or use out faster by drawing in dirt and particles or limiting the movement of the part. The proper quantity of lubricant ought to make the surface area of the 'ring appear wet. You need to never ever see portions or globs of lube.</p>
