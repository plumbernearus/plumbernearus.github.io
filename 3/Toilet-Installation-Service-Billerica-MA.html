<p>Every reasonable buyer inspects a minimum of a number of things before making a down payment on a house. When you come across a plumbing issue it might be a minor leak or a more major scenario. If you have an issue with the sewer line it is an extremely serious problem that needs instant attention.  The sewer line is the pipe that links your house to the outside sewer system.
