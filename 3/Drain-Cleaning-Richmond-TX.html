<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Richmond TX</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic supply of water line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>You could be losing cash with every flush if your toilet was manufactured prior to 1994. Older toilets consume to 3.5 gallons per flush-- more than double the contemporary requirement.
