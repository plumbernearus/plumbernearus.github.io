<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
