<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that need to also be well kept to help prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and break or just be so squished that it does not fill the space in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Much like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. We highly suggest likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
