<p>Some makers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
