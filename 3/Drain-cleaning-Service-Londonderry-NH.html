<p>Depending upon the size of your home, repiping might take anywhere from a number of days to a week. Usually, it is possible to do the bulk of the work that requires total water shut off while you are out and about during the day, so you experience very little disruption to your day-to-day routine. To start the repiping process, the plumbing group will initially cover any carpet and furniture to safeguard them from dust and debris. They will then make little cuts in the wall and drywall to find the pipes and after that remove and replace them, leaving as much of the initial structure material as possible undamaged.</p>
<p>IRWD is devoted to providing safe, high quality water to customers. Our substantial water quality program runs 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water provided to our consumers is kept free from harmful pollutants. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to equipment consisting of a nonpotable compound, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination may occur when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or cooling and heating system, into the safe and clean water system. This can happen through a process called backflow.</p>
