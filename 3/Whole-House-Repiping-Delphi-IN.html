<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>
