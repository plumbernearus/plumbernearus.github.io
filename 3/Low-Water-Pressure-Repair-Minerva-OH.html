In this case, repiping your house is needed due to the fact that not just are your pipes old, but your water quality is impacted too. The box will consist of all the parts you need to install it when you buy a new disposal. Before you delve into removing the old unit, take a couple of moments to familiarize yourself with all these parts. Put them together in the right order and experiment with the locking mechanism. Understanding how everything fits together ahead of time will make the job a cinch.</p>
