<p>To help prevent clogs within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the approach laid out above. Due to the fact that the baffle efficiently halves the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste should travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is particularly true. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close.
