<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>
