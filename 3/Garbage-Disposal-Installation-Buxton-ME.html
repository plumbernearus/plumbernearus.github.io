<p>Installation and replacement expenses are typically comparable, though replacement typically will not require service charges, such as application fees.

Do-it-yourselfers and contractors are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the office number noted on the building authorization. Inspections need to be made after structure excavation (before pouring concrete), after rough-in (before hiding work), and upon conclusion.
