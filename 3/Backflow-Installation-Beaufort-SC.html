Roto-Rooter's specialist plumbers provide a complete range of basement plumbing services and drain cleaning company, but basement floor drain cleaning is one of the most common.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
