<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately constant, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than need (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly stored for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
