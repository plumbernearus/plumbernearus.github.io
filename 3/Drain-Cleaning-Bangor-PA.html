<p>A reduction in supply side pressure brought on by an event such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire battling, causes the supply pressure to drop listed below the client side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve allows the excess client side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release till the supply side pressure again goes beyond the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>Standard water softeners found in house supply and hardware stores will get rid of nearly all the calcium and magnesium from the raw water throughout the softening process.

Water materials with high levels of iron and manganese (higher than 10 ppm) might need pretreatment to lengthen the lifespan of a water softener. The effects of a malfunctioning toilet vary significantly-- from the mild inconvenience of a tank that will not stop running to the unsanitary and potentially devastating back-up of unflushed sewage.
