It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational use, water pressure pushes the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really essential here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect against back pressure.
