Domestic water that shows up to your Ohio house carries minerals that can cause rust on metal parts and components.

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a complete repipe in certain areas, based on our experience.</p>
