<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly stored for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
