The Supertech serviced our air conditioning unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition.

I would highly suggest Hunter for any concerns you may have.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
