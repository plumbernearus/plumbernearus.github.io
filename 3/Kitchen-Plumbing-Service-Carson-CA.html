<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
