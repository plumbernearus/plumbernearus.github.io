<p>A common water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line.

From new bathroom components to custom counter tops, we really have it all. Our stock makes us the best plumbing company for any job in Seattle, WA.

<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a process called ion exchange to get rid of hard water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical process called Template Assisted Condensation (TAC). This process transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a solidity crystal that won't stay with any surface in your home, keeping your home appliances and hot water heaters devoid of difficult water scale develop. Salt-free softeners are also called water conditioners because they do not actually soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And due to the fact that these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to eliminate recorded ions.</p>

<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water travels through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This procedure continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>
