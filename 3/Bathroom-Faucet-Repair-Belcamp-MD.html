The images offer a sample of a backflow device located behind the water meter.</p>
<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high threat" establishments.</p>
