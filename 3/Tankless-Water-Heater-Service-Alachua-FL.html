Attach the backup ring, the fiber or rubber gasket and the installing ring to the flange from beneath the sink. Make sure you snap the backup ring in place.

The majority of residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas hot water heater with special venting systems also are available. However they're harder to install, and we won't deal with them here.</p>
