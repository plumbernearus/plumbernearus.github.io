<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Millen GA</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic supply of water line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
