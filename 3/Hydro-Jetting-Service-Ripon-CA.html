<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The 2 indicators of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate in time, they slowly start to restrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much buildup to take place, so by the time you discover it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water system, affecting your water quality.</p>

Plumbing codes mandate that safe and clean water products be protected against backflow at all cross-connections. We provide the largest choice of backflow prevention solutions for any application.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to shut down the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. Examine the directions if your valve is a different design from the one we show. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be gotten rid of by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Again, it is suggested to examine the manufacturer's instructions for unique preventative measures.</p>
