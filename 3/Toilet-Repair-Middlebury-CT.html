<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly kept for later use when demand rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
