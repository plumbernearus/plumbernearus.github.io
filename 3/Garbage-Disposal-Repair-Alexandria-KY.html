A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
