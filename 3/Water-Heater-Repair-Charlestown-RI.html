<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly stored for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
