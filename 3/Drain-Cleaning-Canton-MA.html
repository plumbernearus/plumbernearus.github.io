<p>Our recommendation: Normally you'll wish to opt for PEX pipes not just due to the fact that they are economical, but because they're reliable and simple to install. If you have concerns about what type is pipe is right  for your house, consult a plumber for more details. Attach the backup ring, the fiber or rubber gasket and the mounting ring to the flange from underneath the sink. Ensure you snap the backup ring in location.

<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced due to the fact that of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
