<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regrowed, the beads become full of salt ions from the water softener salt. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are brought in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the tough water ions.
