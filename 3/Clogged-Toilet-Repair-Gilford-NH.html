<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
