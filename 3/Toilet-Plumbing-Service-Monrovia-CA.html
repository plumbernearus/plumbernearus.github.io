While there's not a precise timetable as to when you should repipe your house, you need to definitely look into repiping if they have not been done in 50 years or more-- particularly if you reside in an older house constructed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our air conditioning unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech describe what exactly was wrong with the system, how he repaired the issue, and how to prevent a reaccuance. I would extremely advise Hunter for any problems you might have.</p>
<p>If you need to hardwire the unit, wait up until it's set up under the sink. Keep in mind: It's most likely a good concept to shut off power at the breaker now, so as to avoid forgetting to shut it off later on.
