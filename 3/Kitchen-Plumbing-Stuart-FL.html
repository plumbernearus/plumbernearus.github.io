Since the baffle effectively halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is particularly true.

In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
