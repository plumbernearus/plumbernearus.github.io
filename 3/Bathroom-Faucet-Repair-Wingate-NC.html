<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Wingate NC</h3>

Nevertheless, other indications of hot water heater trouble can be less easy to area.

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many home centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
