<p>This is an entirely valid concern that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, obviously, as crucial as your water heater, water line, or drainpipes. Nonetheless, it includes a reasonable amount of performance to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a reasonably small round device installed under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal system pulls down wastewater and any material debris by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such debris. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily flow into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>A. Using phosphoric acid typically will help remove them if you have rust areas. If you would like to attempt the gentlest method possibly try utilizing some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola includes a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not suffice then utilize Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (make sure to read the instructions and security warnings first!). Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to eliminate rust discolorations and it's easily available at many hardware shops.</p>
