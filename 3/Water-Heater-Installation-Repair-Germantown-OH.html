Water softening is the elimination of calcium, magnesium, and specific other metal cations in difficult water The resulting soft water needs less soap for the very same cleaning effort, as soap is not lost bonding with calcium ions.

<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it challenging to access to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls.

Toilets must definitely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
