<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it challenging to access to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls.

Toilets must definitely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
