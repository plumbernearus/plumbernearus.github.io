This is specifically typical after returning from a trip or not utilizing your house's water supply for an extended period of time. If this happens only when your warm water is running, it might be due to a rusty hot water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your home.</p>
<p>If you home utilizes a septic system and drain field, you'll need an unique garbage disposal. The unit should grind the waste even finer to prevent obstructions and permit the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. As soon as, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but must then transition to galvanized. I am not sure why that need to be. It is also permitted to use black iron if it is probably covered with a galvanized finishing (which is basically a special paint"). PG&E frequently does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>
