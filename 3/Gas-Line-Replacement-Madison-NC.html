<p>Sometimes, leaks can be sealed by welding or comparable techniques. However, if leaks keep springing up in the exact same length of pipe, then it's likely that you're handling a defect in the pipe, which needs to be changed. A leak is just a matter of time if you observe corrosion or rust on a pipe.

<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
