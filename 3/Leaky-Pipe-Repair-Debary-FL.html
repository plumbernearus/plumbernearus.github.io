<p>A reduction in supply side pressure brought on by an incident such as a water main break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire combating, causes the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve permits the excess customer side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge till the supply side pressure again surpasses the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve between the check valves and listed below the first check valve.

An RPBA works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and might be utilized to isolate health or non-health risks.</p>
