Many water softeners utilize an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank replenished.</p>
