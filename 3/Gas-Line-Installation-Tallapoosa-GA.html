<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this brine passes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
