<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet.

Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, affecting your water quality.</p>
