Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
