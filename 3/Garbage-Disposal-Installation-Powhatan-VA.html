<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Powhatan VA</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic supply of water line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was easier to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is an issue. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>

Consumer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get an estimate from personal plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of business we called would offer a quote over the phone.
