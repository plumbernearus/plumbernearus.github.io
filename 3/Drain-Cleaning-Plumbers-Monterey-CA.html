The sink is the focal point in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will trigger problems. There are a number of methods house owners can unclog a kitchen sink, including using a sink plunger, snaking the drain, or utilizing a service of vinegar and baking soda. For the more extreme clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Wingate plumber.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain new sinks, however these will be labeled to that impact. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Ensure to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
