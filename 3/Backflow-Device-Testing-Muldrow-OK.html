<p>So, how does a softener know when to get down to service? The timing of regeneration depends upon the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every three days, despite whether the water in fact requires it. When required, more recent systems utilize electronic sensors that keep an eye on bead deficiency and other crucial metrics based on your water use and for that reason just restore. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect since they conserve energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
