Apprentices generally receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, as well as some technical instruction, each year. Technical direction includes security, local plumbing codes and policies, and blueprint reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and businesses. Most apprentices go into a program directly, however some begin as helpers or finish a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
