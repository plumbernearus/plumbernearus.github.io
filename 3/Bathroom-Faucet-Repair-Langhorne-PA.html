<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes.

Salt is typically used in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>

<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Langhorne PA</h3>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
<p>If you choose to attempt this job yourself, be prepared to keep meticulous track of about a dozen tiny parts (put the stopper in the sink so none of them fall down the drain). There are many different faucet designs, so you might not have the ability to tell what to replace till you've done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or hire a plumber, this would be a good time to think of whether you want to update the faucet with a new style.</p>
