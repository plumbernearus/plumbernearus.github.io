<p>If you home utilizes a septic system and drain field, you'll need a special garbage disposal. The system should grind the waste even finer to avoid clogs and enable the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields. When, the gas pipe shows up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, but should then shift to galvanized. I am unsure why that should be. It is also permitted to utilize black iron if it is most likely coated with a galvanized finishing (which is basically a special paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E typically does this.</p>

Consumer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a quote from personal plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of the businesses we called would provide a quote over the phone. All of them wanted to look at the situation before committing to a rate, and all wished to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks discovered just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
