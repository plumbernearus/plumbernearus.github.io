Double flush valves are becoming more and more common, as both makers and customers seek brand-new ways to conserve water. Dual flush toilets permit the user to select the level of water needed to flush the toilet based upon whether the waste is strong or liquid. We have actually all heard the old saying, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down." Well, many people find that squicky - therefore the dual flush was born so you can still flush it down if it's yellow, you're just using less water to do it.</p>

<h3>An Easy Approach To Find A Reliable Plumber Brewton AL</h3>
<p>Close all exterior windows and doors and switch on your kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans. Then open a close-by hot water faucet till you hear the burner in the hot water heater spark. After a minute, move a smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Photo 7) on top of the heater. The smoke must be drawn up the vent pipe. If the smoke does not draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Switch off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the problem.</p>
<p>If your toilet was produced before 1994, you could be squandering money with every flush. Older toilets use up to 3.5 gallons per flush-- more than double the modern requirement. Plumbers typically use water conditioning and water softening services. These can be extremely important, particularly for house- and entrepreneur in areas with iron or sulfur in the water. The instant advantage to this is superior accessibility for homes and locations with higher needs. While an electric heater might serve for smaller sized families, the gas heater might be a better option for matching needs.</p>
