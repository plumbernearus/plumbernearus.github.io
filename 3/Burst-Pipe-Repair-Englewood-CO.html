Claims may be denied due to the fact that the standard HO-3 homeowners' policy particularly omits "a loss as the result of a water leak over a prolonged time period." Call your insurance representative and confirm your protection. Once you have actually reviewed your policy and validated what is covered and what is not covered, check with your representative to verify that your understanding is correct.</p>
<p>Among the most typical toilet problems that we get required are issues with toilet clogs. However, there are numerous different problems that can take place to your toilet.
