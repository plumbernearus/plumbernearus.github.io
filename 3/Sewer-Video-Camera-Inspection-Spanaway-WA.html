<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance could happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
