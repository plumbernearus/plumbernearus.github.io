For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to solidify and break or just be so squished that it doesn't fill the area as well as it used to, and you end up with water all over the location.

Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure whatever is in tip-top shape.</p>
