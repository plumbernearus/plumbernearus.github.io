<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical service is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced: whole-house repiping. If you live in an older house (constructed pre-1970) or any home with galvanized steel plumbing, this is an option to consider.

<p>Your first step is to shut off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, shut off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a various style from the one we show, check the instructions. After installing the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
<p>You live in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and wear away when they get old. Need a plumbing contractor to assist on your remodel or new building and construction task? It's our specialized. Provide us a call at 206-633-1700. We anticipate working with you.</p>
<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Since water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly constant, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily kept for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
