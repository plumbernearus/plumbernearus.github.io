<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Since water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately constant, use never exactly matches supply.
