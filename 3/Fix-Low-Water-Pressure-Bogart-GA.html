Fractures in the Porcelain: Fractures in the toilet bowl can lead to bathroom flooding if not attended to rapidly.

<p>Clogs are easily prevented with a few crucial steps. Location drain strainers on all drains, if possible. These strainers capture hair, food and other particles before it gets stuck, preventing the need of drain cleaning. Although they don't capture whatever, it helps the system significantly. Installing a tankless hot water heater is a greater upfront financial investment, however these units can considerably cut the cost of regular monthly energies.

<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of most repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that must also be well kept to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to break and solidify or merely be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly suggest likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything remains in tip-top shape.</p>
