<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. takes place when there is a reduction in provided pressure to the water flow. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows backwards relative to the direction of the system's water system motion. This opposite flow is usually localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for instance, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes subject to lorry traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from nearby heavy devices operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a complete damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to escape. Often no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose closed down results in a significant pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>

All leakages, worn out fittings, and other plumbing problems will be solved.</p>
