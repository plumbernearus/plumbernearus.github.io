Backflow preventers are also required by the plumbing code. Except within Coastline, the plumbing authority for Seattle Public Utilities customers is King County plumbing (Public Health - Seattle & King County). The City of Shoreline is the plumbing authority within Shoreline's city limitations. Seattle Public Utilities works with both King County plumbing and the City of Coastline when it concerns backflow preventer requirements.</p>
<p>The cost depends on the size of the home and the variety of restrooms and plumbing fixtures-- utility room, damp bar, mud room, and so on. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to get to the plumbing will include $500 or more to your final costs. While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment.

For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to solidify and split or simply be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. We strongly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure whatever is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
