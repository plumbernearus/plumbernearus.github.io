<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
