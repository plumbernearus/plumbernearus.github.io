<p>Lastly, the most sophisticated and complex backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 individually running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if pricey) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
