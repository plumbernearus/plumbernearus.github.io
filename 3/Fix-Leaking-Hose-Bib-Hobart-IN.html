<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains significant quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey.

While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite an annoyance-- for its many designated usages around your house.</p>

The beads end up being complete of salt ions from the water softener salt when freshly regrowed. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your usage. When water is heated up, difficult water causes white or gray deposits. Water softening can be used to reduce these signs.</p>
