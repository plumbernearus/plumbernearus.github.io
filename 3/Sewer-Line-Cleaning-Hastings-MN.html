<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to push the ring up a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
<p>Note that "water conditioner" is often utilized as a fairly broad term that may describe any type of water purification or treatment system.

There are various techniques of conditioning water, but the result must be a liquid solution that does not allow buildup of any kind to harm your plumbing system.</p>
