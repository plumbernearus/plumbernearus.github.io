<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
