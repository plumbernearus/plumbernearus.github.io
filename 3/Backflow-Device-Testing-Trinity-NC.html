<p>An rdc is similar to a DC in that it is a mechanical backflow preventer including 2 separately acting, spring-loaded check valves. However, it typically does not consist of shutoff valves, may or might not be equipped with test cocks or ports, and is usually less reliable than a DC. An rdc is effective versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but should be utilized to separate only nonhealth hazards and is planned for use just in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>
<p>Sometimes a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the issue if this is the case.

At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
