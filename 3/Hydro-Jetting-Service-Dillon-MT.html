Discharge piping connected to a storm sewer shall be equipped with backwater check valve. Another variety of gas heat is the on-demand or tankless sort.

<p>The check assembly was established in the 1950s for the fire protection industry, producing a redundancy created to make sure that one check valve will continue to secure the city supply of water even if the other fails. This assembly likewise allows the closure of one valve to decrease the pressure differential throughout the other, creating a more reliable seal and preventing even minor backflow leak.
