<h3>Easy Basic Kitchen Faucet Repair at Hampton VA</h3>
<p>What is difficult water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a problem-- for its many desired uses around your home.</p>
