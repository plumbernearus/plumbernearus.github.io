<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the safe and clean supply of water and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is needed to be set up. An approved, properly set up and preserved backflow assembly basically gets rid of the danger of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric hot water heater have a shorter life-span than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capacity.

<p>Water softeners come in all sizes and shapes and larger absolutely does not suggest better. WaterBoss Â® utilizes fine mesh resin - smaller sized beads that actually provide more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to allow maximum capacity in a minimum of space. Plus, our patented Directional Circulation Screen system assists guarantee that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter likewise safeguard the resin bed, so we don't need to lose area on freeboard" which is the empty area in conventional water softeners that permit a churning of resin throughout regrowth to launch hardness, sediment and dirt.</p>
