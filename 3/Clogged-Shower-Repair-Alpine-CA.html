<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Alpine CA</h3>
<p>Close all exterior windows and doors and turn on your bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Then open a close-by warm water faucet till you hear the burner in the hot water heater ignite. After a minute, move a cigarette smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Image 7) on top of the heater. The smoke needs to be drawn up the vent pipe. The fumes from the burner aren't venting if the smoke does not draw. Shut off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to fix the problem.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
