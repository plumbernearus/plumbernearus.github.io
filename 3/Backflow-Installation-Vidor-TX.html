<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created since of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
