<p>Those of us in the industry know that cross-connection programs in numerous locations have actually significantly minimized the variety of reported occurrences that happen within our water systems. This has at times resulted in people believing that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there may never really have been a problem in the very first place. This thinking can be both harmful and detrimental. Backflow incidents in water supply are an outcome of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a lowered pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing method to backflow defense. We need to look at each installation for the hazard it presents and then install the appropriate defense.</p>
<p>The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the building; extra, more significant expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure ends up being a problem for homeowners. If installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist determine. Manufacturers of PVC or polyethylene gas piping and its linking fittings consist of Dormont, DriscoPlex, GasTite, Endot, Pro-Flex, Lyall Lyco, Yellowpipe, and others.</p>
<p>When the potable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not effectively safeguarded, non-potable and potable water or liquids can be pushed into the potable supply system. Backflow Preventer meaning: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from reversing in the opposite instructions.</p>
