<p>At Big Blue Plumbing, we are experts in high efficiency warm water heaters. The previous years has actually brought a host of new, more varied options for improving your hot water heater's energy performance and cutting down on your energy bills. Whereas hot water heaters utilized to come in either tank or tankless choices, there are now even more choices for enhancing water heating energy intake. Tankless Water Heaters - If you are tight on space, or if you have an interest in minimizing energy costs when heating water for usage throughout your home, then you might want to consider the installation of a tankless water heater.

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
