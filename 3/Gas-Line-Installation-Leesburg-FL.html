Gurgling noises from a toilet are brought on by air in the drain and ventilation system. A blocked toilet drain or vent line is the root problem. This requires a plumber to fix, however the bright side is that your toilet probably doesn't need to be replaced.</p>

<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water supply line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh.
