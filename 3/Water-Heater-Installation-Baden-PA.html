<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it hard to get to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge job, replacing exposed pipes in a utility, crawlspace, or basement room is relatively uncomplicated, because the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad indication. Toilets should definitely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.
