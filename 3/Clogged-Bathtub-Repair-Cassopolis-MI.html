<p>The Mesopotamians introduced the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples discovered in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 used to eliminate wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk contains the earliest recognized examples of brick constructed Latrines, built atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had quickly removable and exchangeable segments, and allowed for cleaning.</p>
<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario could occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
