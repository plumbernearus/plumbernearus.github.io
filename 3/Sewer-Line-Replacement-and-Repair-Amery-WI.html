Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mix sit for several hours, then flush with boiling water. If it does not work the first time, you can repeat this procedure. We do hot water heaters installations and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
<p>There are 2 popular install systems used for garbage disposers: the basic 3-bolt mount (if you have actually had a disposer set up for some time, it's most likely mounted in this manner) and a newer system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a similar system called "Quick Lock"). Each achieve the same job with little difference, aside from their installation. As the name suggests, the EZ Mount mechanism is meant to be much easier to deal with when repairing a system or setting up.</p>
