<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Unless your bathroom restoration is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might effectively belong to your project requirements. Water gets in the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads.

<p>Lubrication may aid with the placement of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not help the assembly work any much better, it is only there to assist the technician assemble the components into the body without creating damage from friction. The lube must be a food grade lube to ensure the water system is not infected. In a lot of cases the best lubricant is water. The usual usage for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be gently lubed to assure they do not roll out of their retainer.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of house centers bring just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close.
