<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Tuckahoe NY</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
