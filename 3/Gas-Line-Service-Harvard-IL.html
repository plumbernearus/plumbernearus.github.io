<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material covered with favorably charged sodium ions.

The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
