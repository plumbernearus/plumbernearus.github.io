<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your house. When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is usually used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
