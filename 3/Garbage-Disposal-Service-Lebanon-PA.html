<p>The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a house, beside heating & cooling.

<p>Last but not least, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five individually running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During basic water streams at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
