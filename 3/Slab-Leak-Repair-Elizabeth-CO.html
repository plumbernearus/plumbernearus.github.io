<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Elizabeth CO</h3>
<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
<p>Obstructions are quickly prevented with a couple of key steps. Place drain strainers on all drains, if possible. These strainers catch hair, food and other particles before it gets stuck, preventing the need of drain cleaning. Although they do not capture everything, it helps the system substantially. Installing a tankless hot water heater is a higher upfront investment, but these units can substantially cut the cost of regular monthly energies. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that in homes utilizing 41 gallons or less of hot water, on-demand tankless units can conserve between 24% to 34% more energy than tank hot water heater.</p>
<p>Any sewer-related checks will need a camera inspection.

Sewer cameras can go numerous feet into the pipe, so they can be used to scope the main line. The camera will send out a signal when it finds the clog, informing the inspector the specific location. The best way in which to keep your hot water heater in the very best working condition possible is to set up regular hot water heater maintenance with a qualified professional you can trust. When it comes to such qualifiers, we fit the bill. Our specialists will completely examine your system, tuning it up as required to ensure that it remains in prime working order.
