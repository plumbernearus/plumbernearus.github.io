The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows backwards relative to the direction of the system's supply of water motion. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying roadways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, and so on.
