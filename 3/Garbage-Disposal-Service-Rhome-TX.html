Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
