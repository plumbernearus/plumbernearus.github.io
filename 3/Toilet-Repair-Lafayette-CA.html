<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>

And if your house is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal particularly designed to be used with a septic tank. gives an introduction 1 of garbage disposals and septic systems.</p>
