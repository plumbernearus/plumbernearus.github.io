<p>Cured-in location piping is a method used to repair trenchless relining systems. Professional sewer and drain companies like Roto-Rooter are able to from another location line the area of the pipe that is cracked without having to dig a trench. After the interior of the pipe is cleaned and dried, the installers will use the lining to the problem area. The liner is cured in location with jets of hot steam as it molds into all the cracks inside the pipe.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.
