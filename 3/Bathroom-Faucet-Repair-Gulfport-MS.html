While the time needed will differ based upon your home size and the number of discovered breakdowns, it's best to set aside as much as two hours when you arrange an inspection. There's constantly the opportunity that your plumber's previous job will run long and delay the starting time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next appointment, they likely hurried the task (unless you have a very small plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection generally takes when you call to arrange your consultation.</p>
