<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Enfield CT</h3>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to work with a plumber for that burner set. The total repair bill may be in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the new heater. To make sure that we are offering high-quality work and consumer peace of mind, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and thoroughly trained to securely perform hot water heater replacements. In addition to standard water heaters, we also install tankless water heaters, and heat pump water heaters.</p>
