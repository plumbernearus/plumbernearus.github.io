<p>Unless your bathroom restoration is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing may effectively become part of your job requirements. Water enters the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has a negative charge, which draws in the favorably charged minerals in the water (a process referred to as, ion exchange). The mineral deposits hold on to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and streams throughout the house. Tankless technology makes good sense.

In basic, it's an economical solution that will stand the test of time. We typically advise this material, though it will depend.</p>
