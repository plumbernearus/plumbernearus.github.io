I actually received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a significant clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole.
