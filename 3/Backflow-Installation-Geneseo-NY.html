Even more, it needs to be installed in accordance with plumbing codes, manufacturer requirements, and engineering standards for the type of system to be used.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be checked annually. Likewise allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring before operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be checked annually to insure the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
