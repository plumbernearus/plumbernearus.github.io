Consequently residential permits provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be checked annually. Likewise allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring before operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be checked annually to insure the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
