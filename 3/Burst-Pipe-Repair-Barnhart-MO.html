<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical type of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>
