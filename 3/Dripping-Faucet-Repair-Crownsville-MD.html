<p>Normal reasons for problems in sewer lines are tree root intrusion, obstructions (such as foreign items, bathroom tissue, grease, and other particles), deterioration, and broken seals or joints between areas of sewer line. House owners are responsible for maintaining, repairing, and changing natural gas pipes that range from the energy's gas meter to the home's gas equipment.

<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has already been fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Once again, it is advisable to inspect the manufacturer's directions for unique preventative measures.</p>
<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both places. The backflow preventer you choose need to be noted on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently listed must have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
