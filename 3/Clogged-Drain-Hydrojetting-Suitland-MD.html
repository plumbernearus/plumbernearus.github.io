<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver woman believed the price she paid for a plumber to replace her garbage disposal was excessive. Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things in a different way could have conserved her a great deal of cash. For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then unfavorable or decreased pressure in the 2-inch supply line will cause a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>

This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise. A word to the wise: most homeowner insurer will pay to repair a water leak and water damage to your home two times. However if it happens a third time, you run the risk of having your insurance company drop you.

<p>Capacity. Capability is critical in choosing the correct hot water heater for your home. A top factor in correctly sizing your water heater is the FHR (first-hour rating) is the number of gallons of warm water that the hot water heater can provide in an hour when the tank is complete. You won't have sufficient hot water to meet your needs if the water heater tank is too small. If it is over-sized, it will heat more water than you utilize which increases your energy usage and energy expenses.
