The images supply a sample of a backflow device located behind the water meter.</p>
<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might occur. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high danger" establishments.</p>
