<p>The rust inside the pipe can break off and be carried out through the taps. This will cause your water to look brown or rusty, and the water may have a bad or foul odor to it. When the piping in your house begins to show any of these signs of deterioration, you will inevitably need to repipe the whole plumbing system. The reason a toilet won't flush might be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain below the toilet can also be the cause. Hiring a licensed Montgomery County plumber is your first step; a plumber can detect the problem and repair it.</p>
