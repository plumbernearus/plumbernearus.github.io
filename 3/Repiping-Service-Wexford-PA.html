Subsequently residential permits issued after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated every year. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an annually test.
