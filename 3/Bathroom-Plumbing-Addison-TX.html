I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation.
