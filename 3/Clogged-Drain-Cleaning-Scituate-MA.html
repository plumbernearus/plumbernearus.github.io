<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Scituate MA</h3>
<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
