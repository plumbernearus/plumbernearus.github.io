<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Tooele UT</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system must be continually kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
