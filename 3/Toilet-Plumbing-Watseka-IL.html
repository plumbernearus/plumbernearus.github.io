If you notice low water pressure or discolored water, it usually symbolizes rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals develop with time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you might discover lower water pressure. The staining happens when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and flow into your supply of water, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can end up being a health hazard in your water.</p>

An electric hot water heater may take a full hour to heat 25 gallons, and a gas heater might heat up two times that quantity in the same given time and perhaps faster.</p>
