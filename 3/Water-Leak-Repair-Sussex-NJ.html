The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
