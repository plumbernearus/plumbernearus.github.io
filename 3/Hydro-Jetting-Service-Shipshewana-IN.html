Each type is rated on the amount of solidity it can remove before regeneration is necessary. A water softening system may not be the best option for each house owner, particularly if you're just looking to enhance particular elements of your water, like the taste, rather than attending to solidity in general. Thankfully, there are numerous options readily available for improving the taste of your water, along with for softening the water to particular home appliances or fixtures.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. Many water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank renewed.</p>

<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>

Loosen up the 2 nuts that connect the tee to the tailpiece above and the trap listed below. Attempt lowering the tee to see if the tailpiece is long enough. If it's not, you'll need to replace it with one that's somewhat longer.</p>
