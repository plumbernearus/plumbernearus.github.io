<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being full of salt ions from the water softener salt when freshly restored. As tough water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. When water is heated, tough water causes gray or white deposits. Water softening can be used to reduce these signs.</p>
<p>In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get precipitated. Rapid heating gas heaters, as a general guideline, will heat water far quicker than an electric hot water heater of the same standard dimensions and capacity. An electrical hot water heater may take a complete hour to heat 25 gallons, and a gas heater might heat up two times that quantity in the very same given time and possibly much faster.</p>
