<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
