<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily stored for later use when demand rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
