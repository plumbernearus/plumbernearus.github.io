This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water system pipeline. The height is required to get rid of the ambient atmospheric pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high prevents a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simpleness of its style and absence of moving parts. However, it might be not practical in many situations to install a pipe section of this length. Moreover, a barometric loop will not prevent back pressure from forming as the outcome of a pump failure.</p>
