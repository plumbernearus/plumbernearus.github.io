<p>Re-piping is a procedure of changing the supply pipes in a house or organisation. It is not a short-term fix or a replacement of short areas of pipe, but a total replacement of your supply plumbing system. There are several reasons you might need to repipe your house or service. Corrosion of pipes may trigger low water pressure, rusty colored water, lowered water flow, or leaks. If you are going to renovate it is a great time to repipe before you paint or complete your walls.  It is essential to understand the scope of the project before work is started. If you discover an isolated leak or a small portion of your existing piping leaking, or valves that are corroded or split, it is rather potentially a sign of a bigger issue.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close.
