<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water passes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are consequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain along with the firmness ions) and the bed is thought about fully regenerated.</p>
