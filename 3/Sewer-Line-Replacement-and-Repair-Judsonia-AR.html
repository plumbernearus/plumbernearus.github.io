<p>106.2.1 Fixing Leakages. The stopping of leaks in drains, water, soil, waste or vent pipe, provided that if any concealed trap, drainpipe, water, soil, waste or vent pipe becomes defective and it ends up being essential to get rid of and replace the same with brand-new material, such work shall be considered as brand-new work and a permit shall be obtained and an inspection made as supplied in this Code, based on the provisions set forth in Area 106.2.2.</p>
<p>Finally, the most sophisticated and complex backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water streams at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if expensive) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
<p>Get rid of the locknut that holds the toilet valve to the tank. Push down carefully on the valve as you loosen the nut. Pull out the old valve.
