Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material.

More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>
