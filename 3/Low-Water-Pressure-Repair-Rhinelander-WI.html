<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive.

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is just recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (normally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
