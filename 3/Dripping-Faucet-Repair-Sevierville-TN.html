Prior to salt begins working in a water softener it needs a little residence time within the reservoir, considering that the salt is dissolving slowly. When one immediately starts regrowth after including salt to the reservoir, the water softener may not work according to standards. After an approval of plans has been released and the assembly has been set up, it needs to be tested by a certified tester.
