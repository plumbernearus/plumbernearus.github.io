<p>Installation and replacement costs are frequently equivalent, though replacement normally will not need added fees, such as application fees. New meters must meet guidelines and code requirements for their positioning, and gas service providers may require a special meter for their services, limiting your choices. Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the office number noted on the structure permit. Inspections must be made after structure excavation (before pouring concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon completion. KEEP IN MIND: If malfunctioning work is found, the inspector will provide a violation notice, and a particular period of time is allocated to correct the problem.</p>
<p>Plastic pipe is a commonly used material since it is lightweight and versatile. Its seamlessness makes it a good product for installation in unstable environments.
