No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not do the trick then utilize Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (make sure to read the directions and security warnings first!).
