The very best and best kind of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). The appropriate backflow prevention device is required if an air gap is not possible. This backflow device is thought about a containment" backflow preventer and is managed by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water supplier.</p>
