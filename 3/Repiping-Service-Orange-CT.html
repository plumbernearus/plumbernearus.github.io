<p>To help avoid clogs within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of utilize the method set out above. Because the baffle effectively halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap, this is particularly true. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
