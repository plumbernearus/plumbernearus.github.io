<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
