<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
