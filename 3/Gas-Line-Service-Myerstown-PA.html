<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Since water need varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly saved for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
