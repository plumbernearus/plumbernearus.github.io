<h3>Leaky Faucets at Gilbert AZ - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>

I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole.
