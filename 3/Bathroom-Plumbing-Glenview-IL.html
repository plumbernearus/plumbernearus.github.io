<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank renewed.</p>

<h3>Bathtub Faucet Repair Tips and Techniques at Glenview IL</h3>
<p>The waste disposal unit as we know it today was initially sold to Americans in the mid-1930s. The units took off in popularity during the 1940s through word-of-mouth. Today, it's estimated that over 50% of American families have a garbage disposal in their kitchen. CenterPoint Energy's Home Service Plus uses you an optional Pipe Defense Plan for just $3.95 a month. It covers interior, easily accessible, natural gas pipes ranging from the gas meter to your gas home appliances.</p>
<p>Like any major home appliance, your hot water heater will start to use down and reveal signs of aging. A lot of homeowners begin experiencing issues with their water heaters around the 10-year mark, so if the water heater in your home was already installed when you bought it, then you may need reliable water heater replacement and installation services. To fix the basic clogged drain problem, we will utilize a drain snake to acquire any obstructions and fish them out. The snake is pressed through the drain line until it reaches the clog, removing it. A drain snake is a long and agile  device, which can suit even the smallest of pipes.</p>
<p>You can discover great deals of repair directions on the internet, so the first thing you need to know is that for anything beyond an irritating drip-drip-drip you need to close the shutoff valves below to save water and secure against the leak all of a sudden worsening while you're asleep or away. You need to also understand that except for cosmetically covering a chip in the porcelain and sealing around the joint, there's not much to repair on the sink itself; a problem will suggest a sink replacement.</p>
<p>Metal-on-metal grinding noise-you know something's wrong when you turn the switch to turn on the garbage disposal and all you get is a hum-or a loud. Thankfully, replacing a disposal isn't hard, even if you have not done much plumbing. We spoke with veteran plumbers and gathered their best pointers for a smooth, trouble-free installation.
