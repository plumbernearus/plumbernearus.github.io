<p>. Leaking Joints: The seals between pipes have actually rotted or broken, permitting water to leave into the ground surrounding the pipes.

Do not turn on or off any electrical switches, appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge might produce a stimulate. Call the Peoples emergency hotline when you are in a safe place.</p>
