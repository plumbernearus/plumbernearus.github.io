If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety preventative measures you must require to protect yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions likewise allow alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water.
