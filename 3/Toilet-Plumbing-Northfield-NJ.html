The heating aspect can be via the use of electrical power, oil, or gas. The gas water heaters make use of gas or LPG to heat up the water. The gas models are likewise cheaper to operate than the electrical types and are a favorite for commercial and residential purposes. When it comes to the benefits of electric tank hot water heater, they are safer and easier to maintain compared to their gas equivalents.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it should put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank renewed.</p>
