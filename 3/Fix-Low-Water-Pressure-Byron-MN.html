Consumer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a quote from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of the businesses we called would provide a price quote over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the circumstance prior to committing to a price, and all wanted to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks discovered just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
