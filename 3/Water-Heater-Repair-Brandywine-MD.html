<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could happen. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high risk" facilities.</p>
