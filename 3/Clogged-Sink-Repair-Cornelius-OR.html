<p>Salt intake from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. If health or ecological factors necessitate restricting salt, substituting potassium chloride for sodium chloride might be suitable.

The regeneration procedure can be arranged instantly with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
