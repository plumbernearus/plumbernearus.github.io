<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been shown to be a threat to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a reduced pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping containing copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
