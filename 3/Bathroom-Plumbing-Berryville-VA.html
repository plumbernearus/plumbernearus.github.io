In a different drain path, small pipes range from the tub and sink to ultimately meet up with a larger one below the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the home.

If you haven't done so already, we recommend installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to alert you of any potential gas leakages.</p>
