<p>Even if all appears well with your water heater, it's a good concept to schedule hot water heater service from time to time simply to make sure that everything is kosher.

Each spring-loaded check valve is set to allow water at expected operational pressure to flow through. Should backflow take place, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs slam the valves shut tight, avoiding the entryway of cross contamination water.</p>
