Fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. If backflows occur from them, these water functions are thought about a health hazard. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location need to be shown on building plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a water fountain or garden pond must be tested upon installation and then every year.</p>
