<p>Lubrication may aid with the placement of some parts within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any much better, it is just there to assist the service technician put together the components into the body without developing damage from friction. The lube should be a food grade lubricant to assure the water supply is not polluted. In most cases the very best lubricant is water. The usual use for lube in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings must be gently lubricated to guarantee they do not roll out of their retainer.

These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily kept for later use when demand rate surpasses supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
