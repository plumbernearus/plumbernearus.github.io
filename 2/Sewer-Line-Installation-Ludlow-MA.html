Recently, nevertheless, toilets utilizing a vacuum flushing system have actually been appearing in increasingly more homes.

Much like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become rusty or so used that they spring a leak. We highly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
