<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Indio CA</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however most of the times it should be much less water.</p>
