<p>A water hardness test would not show a reduced hardness. How do I understand it's working? The FutureSoft is a salt-free system that does not pull out the solidity to replace them with salt. The hardness minerals, calcium and magnesium are still present and being taken shape. You will no longer have the downside to tough water, i.e., scaling, etching and clogging of aerators while retaining the advantageous minerals.

An electric water heater might take a full hour to heat 25 gallons, and a gas heater might heat up twice that amount in the exact same provided time and perhaps faster.</p>
