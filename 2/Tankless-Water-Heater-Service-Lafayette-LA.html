<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be evaluated every year. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an annually test. It is needed that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be checked yearly to guarantee the security of the potable drinking water in your home.
