The client has one month to complete installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notification of Requirements form). Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer.

<p>Sadly, when water is totally stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often ends up being corrosive. Destructive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, specifically in locations where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main cause of the blue and green spots being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks. Most residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More pricey gas water heaters with special venting systems likewise are offered. However they're more difficult to install, and we will not deal with them here.</p>
