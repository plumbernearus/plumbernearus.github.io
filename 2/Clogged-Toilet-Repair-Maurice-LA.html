<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
