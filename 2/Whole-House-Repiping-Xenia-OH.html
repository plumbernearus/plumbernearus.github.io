<p>Regular causes of problems in sewer lines are tree root invasion, blockages (such as foreign items, toilet tissue, grease, and other particles), degeneration, and broken seals or joints in between sections of sewer line. House owners are responsible for maintaining, fixing, and changing gas pipes that run from the utility's gas meter to the home's natural gas devices.
