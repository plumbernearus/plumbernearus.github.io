For each device, the cost can range from a base of $7,500 to $15,000 for midsize structures and $15,000 to $35,000 for bigger structures; this does not include the PE's or RA's style fees. The DEP filing charge is $350 per service connection and the DOB filing fee is a little over 1% of the approximated plumbing cost. The size of the device is also a factor in cost. For instance, a one-inch device can begin at $225, while a three-inch device might cost $2,800. Labor costs also increase with pipe size.</p>

These backflow preventers are less vulnerable to frost damage due to the fact that they are generally set up below ground or in a basement making sprinkler system winterization much simpler.

<p>A newly set up water heater should not produce unusual sounds, but it will start to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder in time as the heater goes to heat the water. Things intensify drastically for families with a high need for hot water. The factors for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which should be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed, a water heater replacement may be needed.</p>
