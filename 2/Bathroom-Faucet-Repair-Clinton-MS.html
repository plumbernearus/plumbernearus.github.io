This device includes no less than five individually operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water flows at design pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline.
