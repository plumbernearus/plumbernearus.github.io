Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole.
