There's a great possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This rust can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous negative results on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>

It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational usage, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain along with preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very crucial here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.  Consider this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to lie a minimum of 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
