<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in many cases it should be much less water.</p>
