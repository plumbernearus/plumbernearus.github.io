<h3>How To Save Water In An Emergency Plumbing Flood Tallahassee FL</h3>
<p>For the purpose of water treatment, solidity is measured in either grains per gallon (gpg) or parts per million (ppm). Grains per gallon is defined as one grain (64.8 mg) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) liquified in one United States gallon (3.785 l) of water. Parts per million is defined as one milligram of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) per litre of water. To convert between gpg and ppm use the following factor; 1 gpg = 17.1 ppm. In addition, milligrams per litre is equivalent to parts per million and can be utilized synonymously.</p>
