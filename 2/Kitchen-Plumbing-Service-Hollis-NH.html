<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) requires plumbing contractors to get a plumbing authorization prior to replacing a backflow or setting up preventer. Your water heater. The pro will next check your water heater. With your hot water heater, he or she is taking a look at water temperature, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless water heater ). Some will likewise flush your hot water heater at this time, which is a yearly maintenance job that prevents hard water and sediment accumulation. To do this, the plumber will drain the water out of the tank with a hose and run clean water through the tank to wash out any buildup.</p>

Consumer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get an estimate from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement.
