<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential authorizations provided after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be checked each year. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems require an annually test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring before running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be evaluated each year to insure the security of the potable drinking water in your home.

This reduction in supply pressure occurs whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied (such as throughout water-line flushing, fire-fighting, or breaks in water pipe). Garbage disposal guarantees last an average of 5 years, but they can range in between 2 and 10 years. Given that the typical life expectancy of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you might wish to acquire a prolonged guarantee.
