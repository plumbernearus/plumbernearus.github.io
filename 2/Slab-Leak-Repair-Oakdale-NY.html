<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to press the call a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
<p>Although the service technician agreed that the customer did the best thing in her efforts to tighten up the pipes, the technician saw that the pipe had become exceptionally worn away throughout the years which a PVC pipe might be much better matched for the client's needs. He turned off the water system to the house, got rid of the rusty system and fit a PVC pipe in its place. Prior to leaving the home, the specialist brought back water flow and tested the pipe.</p>
