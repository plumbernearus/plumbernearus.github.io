Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.

<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Since I like to prepare, I produce a whole lot of meals. We established a short-lived workaround at our visitor bathroom sink, however after a day of this we understood that we needed the sink fixed ASAP.  Fritz was in and out of the home within thirty minutes and he ensures that the sink will stay clog-free for 1 month. If it blocks once again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!  We are really delighted that we picked Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will definitely utilize this company once again and again in the future.</p>
