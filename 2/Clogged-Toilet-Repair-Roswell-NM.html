I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
