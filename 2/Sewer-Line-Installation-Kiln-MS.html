<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. Many water softeners use an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when certain levels are satisfied, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank replenished.</p>

We extremely recommend repiping your house during spring or summer season so you do not have to stress about freezing temperature levels during the repiping procedure if you live in a cold-weather environment. Usually, if the problem is confined to one sink or shower, drain cleaning is most likely the best option.

I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
