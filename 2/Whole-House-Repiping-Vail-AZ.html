<p>Yes, certified and licensed plumbers can make installation and repair changes to the gas piping system. Sinks should be considered like a machine. They use a variety of parts and gadgets that work together for the functionality of a single sink. For example, a kitchen sink might include as many as six separate systems just to offer the overall service we expect. Like any machine, a sink has numerous parts that need repair and maintenance in time. A plumbing license offers 3 inspections. Extra inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections hired on work not finished, not effectively set up, or on an inaccessible property will require re-inspection. It is the permit holder's responsibility to reschedule the inspection and make arrangements for the plumbing inspector to access the property.</p>
