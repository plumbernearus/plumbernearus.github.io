Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed due to the fact that of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
