<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect with time, they slowly start to restrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much buildup to happen, so by the time you observe it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, impacting your water quality.</p>
