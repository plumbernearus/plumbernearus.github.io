<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
