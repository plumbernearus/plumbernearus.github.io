Kinetico Premier Series softeners are consisted of multiple tanks and constructed for quick water circulation to ensure you receive a continuous supply of soft, clean water.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank consisting of countless small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads become complete of salt ions from the water softener salt when newly regrowed. As hard water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the tough water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. When water is heated, tough water triggers white or gray deposits. Water softening can be used to reduce these signs.</p>
