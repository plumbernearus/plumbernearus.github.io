Big Blue Plumbing can buy and handle the license procedure. Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that undergo fouling, use or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be tested occasionally to ensure they are working effectively.

When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
