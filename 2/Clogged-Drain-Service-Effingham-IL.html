<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a reduction in supplied pressure to the water flow, occurs. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment streams in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system motion. This opposite circulation is normally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller sized pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from nearby heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a complete damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to leave. Sometimes no evident physical damage to the pipe is needed, simply the mechanical failure of an essential pump whose closed down results in a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
<p>A. We highly recommend a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers obstruct any water from unfavorable or back pressure in your irrigation system at shutdown from getting in back into your water source, therefore lowering the threat of contamination of your water source. Numerous municipalities require making use of an approved backflow preventer in drip watering systems. You may wish to check with your local town prior to installing your irrigation system.</p>
