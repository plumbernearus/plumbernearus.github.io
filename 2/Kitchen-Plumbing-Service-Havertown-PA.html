The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the system. This can be done at any point prior to installation. If you irrigate with drinkable water, you are needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, drinkable and irrigation, you are also needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
