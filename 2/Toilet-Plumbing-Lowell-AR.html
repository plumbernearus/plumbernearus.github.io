<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made of copper.

The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping containing copper will be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
