Technical direction includes security, local plumbing codes and regulations, and blueprint reading. Apprentices likewise study mathematics, applied physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and businesses. Many apprentices enter a program straight, but some start out as assistants or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
