It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very essential here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not safeguard versus back pressure.
