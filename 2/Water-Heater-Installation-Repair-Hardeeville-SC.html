<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
