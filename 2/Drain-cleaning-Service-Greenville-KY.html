In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly.
