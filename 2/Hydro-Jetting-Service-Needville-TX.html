<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
