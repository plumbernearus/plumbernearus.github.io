<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to cleanse water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are gotten rid of by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and gotten rid of. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to eliminate any remaining contaminants.</p>

Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can position problems.</p>
