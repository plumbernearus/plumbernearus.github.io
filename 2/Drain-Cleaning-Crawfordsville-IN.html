<p>When your hot water heater beings to degrade, you can see how it affects your day-to-day comfort. With a hot water heater replacement, you'll fix your repair problems, and have improved hot water heater efficiency as well. The sodium uptake through softened water depends upon the firmness of the water. Averagely, less than 3% salt uptake originates from drinking softened water. Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the hardness ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide must be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down.</p>
<p>The most effective method to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when water is totally removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically becomes corrosive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in locations where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main cause of the blue and green discolorations being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks. A lot of residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas water heaters with unique venting systems also are available. But they're harder to install, and we won't deal with them here.</p>
