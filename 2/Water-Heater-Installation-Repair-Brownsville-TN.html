<p>Your sewer line problem can lead to sewer backups, and they typically happen in the lowest open drain. This type of issue is typically the outcome of an obstruction in the line. If you do not spot the smell originating from the sewer backup, you may recognize this problem due to the fact that a backup occurs whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink.

Given that the average lifespan of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you might wish to buy a prolonged service warranty.
