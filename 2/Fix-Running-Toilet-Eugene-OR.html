<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two indications of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect with time, they gradually begin to constrict the circulation of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much buildup to occur, so by the time you observe it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, impacting your water quality.</p>
