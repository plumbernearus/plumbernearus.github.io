<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>

The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
