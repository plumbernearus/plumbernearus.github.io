<h3>Leaky Faucets in Elizabethport NJ - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>

I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to push the ring up a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and remove the mount ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink.
