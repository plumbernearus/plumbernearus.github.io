<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
