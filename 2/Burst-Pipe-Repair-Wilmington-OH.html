<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
