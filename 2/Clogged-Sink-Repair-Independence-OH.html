<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
