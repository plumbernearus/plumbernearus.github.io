<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily kept for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
