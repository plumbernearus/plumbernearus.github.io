<p>Close all outside windows and doors and turn on your bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Then open a neighboring warm water faucet until you hear the gas burner in the water heater spark. After a minute, move a smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Picture 7) on top of the heater. The smoke ought to be prepared the vent pipe. The fumes from the burner aren't venting if the smoke does not draw. Shut off the gas to the hot water heater and call a licensed plumber to fix the issue.</p>
<p>The most efficient way to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
