<p>A water softener has a resin tank containing thousands of small resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regrowed, the beads become loaded with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As hard water goes through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are attracted to the resin beads. There, salt ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Difficult water triggers white or gray deposits when water is heated up. Water softening can be used to reduce these signs.</p>
