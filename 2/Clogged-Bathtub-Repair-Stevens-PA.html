<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and easily stored for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
