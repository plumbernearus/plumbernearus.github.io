<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals collect gradually, they gradually begin to constrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long period of time for this much buildup to happen, so by the time you observe it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, impacting your water quality.</p>

It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In standard functional use, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain in addition to preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really important here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.  Think about this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It likewise has to lie at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>
<p>Those of us in the industry know that cross-connection programs in numerous areas have significantly minimized the number of reported incidents that take place within our water supply. This has at times resulted in people believing that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there may never actually have actually been a concern in the first location. This thinking can be both unsafe and counterproductive. Backflow incidents in water supply are a result of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a lowered pressure concept backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or absolutely nothing method to backflow security. We need to look at each installation for the risk it presents and after that install the appropriate security.</p>
