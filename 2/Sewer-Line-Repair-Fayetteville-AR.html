<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Fayetteville AR</h3>

Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of home centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close.
