<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips in Canandaigua NY</h3>
<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the potable water supply and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is required to be installed. An approved, correctly set up and preserved backflow assembly basically eliminates the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of similar quality and capacity. Still, the difference is insufficient to make any substantial changes in the savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater might last 8-15 years, the electric choice will last about 8-12 years.</p>

Utilizing the incorrect fitting might trigger a blockage or leak.</p>
