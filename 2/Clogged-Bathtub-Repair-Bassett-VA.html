<p>What is difficult water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains substantial amounts of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a problem-- for its numerous designated usages around your house.</p>
