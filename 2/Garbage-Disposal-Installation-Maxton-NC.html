<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains.

<p>Even if you take excellent care of your drains by covering them and avoiding putting any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, in some cases obstructions are inescapable.

<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly kept for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
