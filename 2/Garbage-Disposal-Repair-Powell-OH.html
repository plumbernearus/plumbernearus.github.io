While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment.

That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
<p>After eliminating standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain before you gather the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and after that flush with warm water to clear the mix. Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water originating from your water appliances? This is a good indicator that your pipes might be rusting from the inside and therefore, need to be changed. Keep in mind that if the rust-colored water just includes hot water, the cause might be a rusted out water heater-- not your house's piping.</p>
