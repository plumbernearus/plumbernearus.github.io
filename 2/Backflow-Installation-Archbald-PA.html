<p>Video cameras are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing business. A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Need backflow prevention assemblies and assemblies within a property as described in the state required plumbing codes. The water suppliers normally do not have the capability to repeatedly examine every customer's properties for cross-connections and backflow security. Normally, this would consist of the water service connection to each dedicated fire protection system or watering piping system and the water service connection to each of the following kinds of premises: (1) facilities with an auxiliary or recovered water system; (2) commercial, medical, lab, marine or other centers where objectionable compounds are handled in a manner that could trigger pollution or contamination of the general public water supply; (3) properties exempt from the State Plumbing Code inspection and facilities where an internal backflow prevention assembly needed under the State Plumbing Code is not correctly set up or maintained; (4) categorized or restricted facilities; and (5) high structures.</p>
