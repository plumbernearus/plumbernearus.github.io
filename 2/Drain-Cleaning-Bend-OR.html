<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Bend OR</h3>
<p>Reverse osmosis is the process used to cleanse water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three stages. In the prefilter stage, big particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and eliminated. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to eliminate any leftover contaminants.</p>
<p>Take the example of the instantaneous hot shower that uses the point-of-use water heaters; these appliances will supply warm water continuously for the duration you are using the shower. They will stop to work only if there are power issues or if the water heater is defective. In essence, it heats the water as needed with just the amount you need, therefore eliminating the loss incurred with making use of tank water heaters where the water cools and is then reheated.</p>
