<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Binghamton NY</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless most of the times it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>A. We strongly advise a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers block any water from negative or back pressure in your irrigation system at shutdown from entering back into your water source, therefore lowering the danger of contamination of your water source. Many municipalities need using an approved backflow preventer in drip irrigation systems. You might want to consult your local town prior to installing your watering system.</p>
