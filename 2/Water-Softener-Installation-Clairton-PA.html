Homeowners are responsible for keeping, repairing, and changing gas pipes that run from the utility's gas meter to the house's natural gas equipment. When the source of a gas leak or other problem is on a client's gas pipe or associated connections, repair costs can be high.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Copper piping in the Florida area is especially vulnerable to recurring pinhole leaks (deterioration that breaks through the surface of piping), so watch out for bluish-greenish corrosion on copper piping.
