I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
