<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly constant, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily saved for later use when demand rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
