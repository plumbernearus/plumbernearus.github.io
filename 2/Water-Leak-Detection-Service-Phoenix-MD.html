If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a great time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. Set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a various style from the one we show, examine the directions. After installing the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
