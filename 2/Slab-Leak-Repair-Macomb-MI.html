<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly.
