<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin.

Once again, it is advisable to inspect the producer's directions for unique preventative measures.</p>
