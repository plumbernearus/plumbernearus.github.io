For a great seal, hold the hose so it intends straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, check for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>

We inspect that the product used in the plumbing system is authorized by an acknowledged testing laboratory.

You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
