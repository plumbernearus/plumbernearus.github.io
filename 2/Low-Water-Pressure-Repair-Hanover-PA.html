<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style).

This process continues up until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the hardness ions) and the bed is considered fully regenerated.</p>
