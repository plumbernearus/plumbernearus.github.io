Switch off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Remove the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just lift out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the obstruction with a set of tongs or needle-nose pliers. For instance, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use. Since pressure is lost throughout these occasions, water is no longer being pushed forward into your house and will flow in reverse into the city water lines.</p>
<p>Your primary step is to shut off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house.

A versatile supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Pictures 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Image 5). Inspect the directions if your valve is a different style from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
