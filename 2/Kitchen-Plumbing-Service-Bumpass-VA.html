<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>

<h3>Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Bumpass VA</h3>
<p>. Leaking Joints: The seals in between pipes have rotted or broken, enabling water to get away into the ground surrounding the pipes. Assess the sewer lines from property to curb connection, septic system, and drainage systems to thoroughly examine if pipe damage, rust, or major clogs are present. Tree roots are one of the biggest reasons for a sewer line backup. As roots enter the drain line they can cause obstructions and back up into your house.</p>
<p>Your sewer line problem can result in sewer backups, and they generally take place in the lowest open drain. This type of issue is usually the result of an obstruction in the line. If you do not find the smell originating from the sewer backup, you might determine this issue due to the fact that a backup takes place whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your home is dependent upon the main sewer line for correct drainage. If, however, only one drain has backup problems, there's an isolated problem with just that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage problem.</p>
