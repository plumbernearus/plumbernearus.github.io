<p>Sediment Build-Up: If you notice unusual popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your system, this might be an indicator that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating component. Running out of warm water quickly is another sign of sediment build-up, due to the fact that the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate gradually, they slowly begin to restrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a long time for this much buildup to occur, so by the time you discover it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, affecting your water quality.</p>
