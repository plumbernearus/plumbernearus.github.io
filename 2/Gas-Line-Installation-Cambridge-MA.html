<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Cambridge MA</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains considerable quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its many desired uses around your house.</p>

Softeners also will remove approximately 10 parts per million (ppm) of iron and manganese. Water materials with high levels of iron and manganese (greater than 10 ppm) might need pretreatment to prolong the life expectancy of a water softener.
