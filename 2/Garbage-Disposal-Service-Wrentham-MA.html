Consumer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a quote from personal plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of the businesses we called would give a price quote over the phone. All of them wanted to look at the scenario prior to committing to a cost, and all wished to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks discovered just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
