<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Warwick NY</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains considerable amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a nuisance-- for its numerous desired usages around your house.</p>
