Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

The auger or snake" is then used to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
