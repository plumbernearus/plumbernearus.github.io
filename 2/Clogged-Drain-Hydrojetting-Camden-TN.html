It includes an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very important here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.
