<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
