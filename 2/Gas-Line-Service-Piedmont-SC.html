Our devices operate by snaking a rotating cable television with an attached blade through your pipes. The blades will remove the build-up due to grease, soap, tree roots, and other foreign things.

<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water travels through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues till all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about totally regenerated.</p>
