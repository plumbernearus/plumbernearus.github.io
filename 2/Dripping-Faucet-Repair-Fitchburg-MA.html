When the tank leakages, your water heater is dead. The dead giveaway that your hot water heater needs changing is a sluggish drip below, usually showing up as a path of rusty water. This implies that the steel tank has rusted through and can't be repaired. Other symptoms, such as inadequate or no warm water, generally signal other water heater repair problems that you can fix.</p>

Quick heating gas heaters, as a basic rule, will heat up water far faster than an electric water heater of the same basic dimensions and capacity. An electrical water heater may take a complete hour to heat 25 gallons, and a gas heater could warm twice that amount in the same given time and potentially quicker.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often ends up being destructive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, particularly in areas where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main cause of the green and blue stains being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks.
