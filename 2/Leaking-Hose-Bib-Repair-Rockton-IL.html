<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Given that I like to cook, I generate a great deal of meals. We set up a temporary workaround at our guest bathroom sink, but after a day of this we realized that we needed the sink fixed ASAP.

If it clogs again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!
