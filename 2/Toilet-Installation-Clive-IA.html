These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay roughly consistent, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (normally night-time hours), the excess supply of water is safely and cleanly stored for later use when need rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
