<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
