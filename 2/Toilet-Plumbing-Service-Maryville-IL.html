<p>To assist avoid clogs within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, instead of use the technique laid out above. It's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up because the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee. When the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is particularly real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
