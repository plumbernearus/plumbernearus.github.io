Copper is a biostatic material, which implies bacteria will not grow on it. Copper has been utilized (together with PVC pipes) given that the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old buildings.

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
