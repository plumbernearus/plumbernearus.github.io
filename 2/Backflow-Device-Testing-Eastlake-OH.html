<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of home centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
