The intent of electrical inspection is to ensure compliance with the relevant electrical code in order to decrease personal, and structural electrical threats. The cost of the repair.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>
