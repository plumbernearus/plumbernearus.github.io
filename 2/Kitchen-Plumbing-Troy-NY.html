It's an excellent idea to have a professional assess your drain system if you experience blockages and backups in your house more than a couple of times. A drain specialist like TLC will utilize a camera to examine your drain system.

<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
