A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Often a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>

If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous.
