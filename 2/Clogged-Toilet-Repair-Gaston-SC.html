<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the potable supply of water and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is needed to be installed. An authorized, appropriately installed and kept backflow assembly essentially eliminates the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric hot water heater have a shorter life expectancy than gas water heaters of similar quality and capability. Still, the difference is insufficient to make any considerable modifications in the savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electrical option will last about 8-12 years.</p>
