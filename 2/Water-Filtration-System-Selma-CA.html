Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
