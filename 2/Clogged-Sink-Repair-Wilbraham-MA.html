<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
