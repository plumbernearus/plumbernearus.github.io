Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
