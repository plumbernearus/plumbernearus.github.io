The pipe lining process involves our team saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. It is pushed through your pipeline when the felt liner is totally saturated. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all cracks and flaws. If heat is utilized, the liner is left to solidify in place for numerous hours or 60 minutes. Once the process is total, the liner will be eliminated and your pipe will be examined one more time to make certain your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
