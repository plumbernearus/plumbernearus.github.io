<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>

You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
