<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
