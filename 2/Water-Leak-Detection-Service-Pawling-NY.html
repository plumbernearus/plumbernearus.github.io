If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
