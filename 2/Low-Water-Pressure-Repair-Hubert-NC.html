If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely hurried the task (unless you have a really little plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection usually takes when you call to arrange your visit.</p>

If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
