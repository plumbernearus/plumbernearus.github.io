<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Kasson MN</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however most of the times it need to be much less water.</p>
