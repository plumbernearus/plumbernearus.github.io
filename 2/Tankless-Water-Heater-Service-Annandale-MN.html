<p>Just a plumber with experience in repiping can tell you that you need new pipes. Nevertheless, there are some indications that you may need pipe repair services-- or a total pipe replacement.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
