The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could happen. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high danger" facilities.</p>
