<p>Unless your bathroom restoration is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing may effectively belong to your task requirements. Water goes into the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has an unfavorable charge, which draws in the favorably charged minerals in the water (a process referred to as, ion exchange).
