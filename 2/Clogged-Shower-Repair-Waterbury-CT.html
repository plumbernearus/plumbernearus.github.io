<p>6 - The eluate, which is the wastewater from the regrowth process, streams from the regenerated filter via the eluate degasifier (5) to a storage tank (6 ).

<p>So what should you do as a property owner? Firstly, do not try to take on the job of fixing the sink yourself. Employ a professional plumber to manage the task of your sink repair if you desire to avoid significant water line damage.

<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water travels through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent out to drain. This process continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain along with the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about fully regenerated.</p>
