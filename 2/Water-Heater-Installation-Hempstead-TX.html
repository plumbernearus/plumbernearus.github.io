<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow scenario might occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>
