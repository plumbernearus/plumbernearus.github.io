Garden hoses that are used to use chemical fertilizers or pesticides are likewise prone to drawing impurities into your house. If your home was constructed after 1985, it needs to be geared up with backflow-preventing hose bibs. If your home is older, you need to inspect to make certain you have the appropriate security for outside faucets.</p>
<p>Water softeners usually use salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Salt ions are provided from liquified sodium chloride salt, likewise called brine. In the ion exchange process, sodium ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that resemble wet sand. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to potential contamination or poorer quality water, require a backflow prevention device.</p>
