<p>She learnt about the service call charge. The 4 In Your Corner Investigation discovered that's a typical cost. Customer Private investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a quote from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of the businesses we called would offer a quote over the phone. All of them wanted to look at the scenario prior to committing to a rate, and all wished to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks discovered only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
