<p>During the regeneration cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this brine passes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This process continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the firmness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
