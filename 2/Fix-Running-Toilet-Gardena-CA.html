<p>In municipal water supply systems, water is usually preserved at a considerable pressure to allow water to stream to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your home or company. When the pressure drops for some factor such as may happen when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to combat a water or a fire main breaks or some other circumstance takes place, polluted water may be drawn into the system. To prevent such an event, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention approach used. The best and most safe kind of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). The correct backflow prevention device is required if an air gap is not possible. This backflow device is thought about a containment" backflow preventer and is managed by the Ohio Epa and your water supplier.</p>
<p>A reduction in supply side pressure triggered by an event such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire fighting, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve enables the excess consumer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge until the supply side pressure again surpasses the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
