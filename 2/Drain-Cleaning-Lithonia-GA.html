<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge.

The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high threat" establishments.</p>
