<p>This ion exchange procedure is helped with by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with sodium ions. This is another mix that can work on sink clogs. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and put down the drain. Let the mix sit for numerous hours, then flush with boiling water. You can duplicate this procedure if it doesn't work the very first time. We do hot water heaters installations and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper mount ring (flange install) enough to press the phone a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring against the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
