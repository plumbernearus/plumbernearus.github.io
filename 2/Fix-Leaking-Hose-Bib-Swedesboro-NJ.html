<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing stoppage service might look like a waste of money. Why invest in professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will work? While chemical drain cleaners may be an economical solution, the harsh active ingredients corrode your inner drain pipe, with time, creating weak spots in the pipe that are likely to burst. Handling fixing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>There are 2 popular mount systems utilized for garbage disposers: the standard 3-bolt mount (if you've had actually a disposer installed for a long time, it's most likely installed in this manner) and a more recent system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a comparable system called "Quick Lock"). Each accomplish the very same task with little difference, aside from their installation. As the name suggests, the EZ Mount mechanism is meant to be simpler to handle when installing or repairing a system.</p>

After your new PEX water supply has actually been linked to all fixtures and checked for proper performance, IGD Plumbing's team will close the drywall openings with the original drywall. If you have any unique textures that need to be repaired, IGD Plumbing can likewise help with this process.</p>
