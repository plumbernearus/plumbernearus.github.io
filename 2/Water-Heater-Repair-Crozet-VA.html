The flapper isn't sealing under regular pressure if pressing down on the flapper stops the noise. Switch off the water, flush the toilet to empty the tank and after that run your finger around the rim of the flush valve seat. Clean the flush valve seat with an abrasive sponge or ScotchBrite pad if you feel mineral deposits. Don't utilize anything that may roughen it. If cleaning the flush valve seat does not solve the problem, you need to replace the flapper.</p>

<p>She knew about the service call fee. The 4 On Your Side Investigation discovered that's a typical cost. Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a price quote from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of business we called would provide an estimate over the phone. All of them wished to take a look at the circumstance before committing to a cost, and all wished to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks found only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
