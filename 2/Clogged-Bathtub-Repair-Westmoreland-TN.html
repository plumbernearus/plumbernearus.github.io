<p>Unless your bathroom remodelling is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing might extremely well be part of your job requirements. Water gets in the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has a negative charge, which brings in the favorably charged minerals in the water (a process known as, ion exchange). The mineral deposits hold on to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and flows throughout your house. Tankless technology makes good sense.

Toilets must absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet should be changed. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>
