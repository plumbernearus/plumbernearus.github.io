As this salt water goes through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent to drain. This process continues up until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain together with the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about totally regrowed.</p>
