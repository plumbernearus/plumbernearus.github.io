<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to push the call a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange). Utilize a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and eliminate the mount ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
<p>Low Water Pressure - Low water pressure is the leading issue with most homes and company' alike. Simply said it is difficult to get casserole dishes or any big serving piece clean without any pressure in the faucet or sprayer. Mineral deposits are also a significant culprit, blockages from food bits, clogs in aerator screens all certainly stop water circulation. The most severe could be water leaking, blocked lines to the cut off, and even worse a frozen pipe entering into your home or structure.</p>
