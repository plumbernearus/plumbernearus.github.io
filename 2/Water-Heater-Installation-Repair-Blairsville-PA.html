<p>Leaks are sneaky. While the time required will vary based upon your house size and the variety of found malfunctions, it's best to reserve up to 2 hours when you arrange an inspection. There's always the chance that your plumber's previous task will run long and delay the beginning time. If the plumber surfaces in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next appointment, they likely hurried the task (unless you have a really little plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection typically takes when you call to arrange your appointment.</p>

Then check it to ensure it's running correctly. If the disposal has actually overheated, you might need to flip the switch found on the side or bottom of the unit underneath the sink.</p>
