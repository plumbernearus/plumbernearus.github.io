<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly.
