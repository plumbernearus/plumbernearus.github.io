<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two indications of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up in time, they slowly begin to restrict the circulation of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a long time for this much accumulation to happen, so by the time you notice it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, impacting your water quality.</p>

<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. This big quantity of trash does not need to go in the trash bin if it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that can taking a trip through the sewage pipes without impeding water circulation.

<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, lowered iron will be eliminated by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin has actually already been fouled. Again, it is suggested to examine the maker's guidelines for unique preventative measures.</p>
<p>While not every state needs insurance coverage prior to contractor licenses are issued, having your own warranties the safety of your business.
