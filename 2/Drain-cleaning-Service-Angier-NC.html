<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair at Angier NC</h3>

The minimum accepted backflow prevention assembly for unlisted threats will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Cross Connection Control Program.</p>

The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new unit.</p>
