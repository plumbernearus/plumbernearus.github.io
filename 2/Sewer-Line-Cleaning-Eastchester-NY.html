<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
