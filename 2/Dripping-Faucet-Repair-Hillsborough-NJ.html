<p>Reverse osmosis is the process utilized to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 phases. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while liquified solids are captured and removed. Lastly, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to get rid of any leftover impurities.</p>
<p>Water softening is the removal of calcium, magnesium, and certain other metal cations in hard water.
