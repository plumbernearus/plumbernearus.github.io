<p>Our kitchen sink clogged over the weekend.  Since I like to cook, I generate a great deal of meals. We established a short-term workaround at our guest bathroom sink, however after a day of this we realized that we required the sink fixed ASAP.

If it obstructs again within that time, he will come out and fix it for free - that is what I call service!  We are extremely pleased that we selected Fritz Drain Service to fix our kitchen sink and will certainly use this company again and once again in the future.</p>
