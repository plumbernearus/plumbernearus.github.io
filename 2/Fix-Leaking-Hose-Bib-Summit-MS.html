<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Summit MS</h3>
<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
