<p>A. Using phosphoric acid usually will help eliminate them if you have rust spots. If you wish to try the gentlest method possibly attempt using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and then more Coke, over and over, etc. Then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the directions and security warnings first!), if that doesn't do the trick. Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to eliminate rust spots and it's easily available at many hardware stores.</p>
