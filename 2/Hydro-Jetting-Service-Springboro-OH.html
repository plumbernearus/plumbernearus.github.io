<p>A leaking toilet is another typical problem house owners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than likely means your toilet has a leak.

The drip pan is installed under the water heater in order to collect any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the house or into a suitable drain. A perfect time to replace or install a drip pan is when the hot water heater is being changed.</p>
