Kinetico Premier Series softeners are consisted of multiple tanks and constructed for fast water circulation to ensure you receive a continuous supply of soft, clean water.</p>
<p>Lubrication may aid with the positioning of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not help the assembly work any much better, it is only there to help the specialist put together the parts into the body without developing damage from friction. The lubricant needs to be a food grade lubricant to ensure the water supply is not infected. In most cases the best lubricant is water. The normal usage for lube in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings should be gently lubed to ensure they do not roll out of their retainer. The use of excessive lubricant can cause the backflow prevention assembly to wear or stop working out earlier by drawing in dirt and debris or limiting the motion of the element. The correct amount of lube ought to make the surface of the 'ring appear wet. You need to never ever see pieces or globs of lube.</p>
