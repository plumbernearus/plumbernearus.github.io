<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately constant, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly kept for later use when demand rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
