<p>To help prevent blockages within the tee (a repercussion of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than use the method laid out above. Due to the fact that the baffle efficiently halves the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially true when the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
