<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Regrow your softener with potassium chloride instead of salt chloride (salt). Potassium chloride is offered at many shops that offer softener salt. Since the softener's salt water tank nests inside of the salt tank, a single tank or cabinet-style system requires less space. Clogged obstruction and drainage problems might start as small problems but can quickly speed up into significant concerns. A clogged drain can even result in slow water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and pricey repairs.</p>
