After finishing your high school diploma or General Educational Advancement (GED) sometimes, you might want to think about attending a plumbing apprenticeship program.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a stringent low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
