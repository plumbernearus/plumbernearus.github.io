<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Washougal WA</h3>
<p>Reverse osmosis is the process utilized to cleanse water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three phases. In the prefilter stage, large particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and eliminated. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to get rid of any leftover impurities.</p>
<p>The most effective way to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
