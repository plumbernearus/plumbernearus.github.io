However while small drips must not be trigger for concern, house owners must keep an eye on the water heater leaks.

All prospective or existing cross connections must be safeguarded from backflow by the installation of an appropriate backflow prevention device.

<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this salt water travels through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This process continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain together with the firmness ions) and the bed is considered totally regrowed.</p>
