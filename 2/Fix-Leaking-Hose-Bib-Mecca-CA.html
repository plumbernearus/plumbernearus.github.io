<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Mecca CA</h3>
<p>Our procedure starts with an inspection of the numerous problems dealt with by the homeowner, this is followed by among our extensive group of specialists placing a camera into the drains to determine the blocked area and determine how best to continue.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
