If you have a clogged drain, it is incredibly crucial that you do not try to unclog it yourself because this could potentially cause a large leak and more expensive repairs.

The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, but it does not grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck.
