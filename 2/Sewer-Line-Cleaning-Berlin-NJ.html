When it concerns the issue of hard water, a traditional water softener in fact eliminates silica, magnesium and calcium ions, leaving it with little quantities of what is referred to as momentary hardness". The softener replaces these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
