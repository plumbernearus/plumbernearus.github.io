<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the best 1st experience with the start of our home improvements. George and Anthony did an amazing job for us. They went above and beyond any expectations that we had. They likewise worked around our specific requirements for our home.

<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to insert television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may need to make a time-wasting trip to the shop. To prevent this, make certain the new garbage disposal installation package consists of a tube, or buy one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>If you happen to have a store vac it will be simpler to remove the water with it instead.  Often times you might even have the ability to unclog the drain by holding the nozzle near to the drain as you draw out the water. For professional garbage disposal installation, give Mr. Rooter a call at (855) 982-2028. Given that the pipes are easier to gain access to and replace, it costs less to do the work and takes less time. Then, as your spending plan permits, we can attend to other areas of the house and gradually replace all of the pipes over an amount of time, rather than all at once.</p>
