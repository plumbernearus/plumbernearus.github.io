<p>A decrease in supply side pressure brought on by an incident such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire fighting, causes the supply pressure to drop below the consumer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Examine Valve enables the excess consumer side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release till the supply side pressure again surpasses the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or till the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
