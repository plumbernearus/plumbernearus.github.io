<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two indications of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up over time, they slowly begin to restrict the circulation of water, resulting in low water pressure.

Red or brown water results when little bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, impacting your water quality.</p>

Wipe with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not do the trick then utilize Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and security cautions initially!).
