<h3>24 Hour Plumbers & Services In Selma NC</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Unfortunately, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, however when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Often a property owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Often unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering incantations to the drain gods.</p>
<p>As toilets grow older, they need to work more difficult to do their jobs. Harder work indicates more water. Even if your toilet operates efficiently, it's also possible that it's merely an old style that utilizes a lot of water. If you're stressed over your water costs, consider replacing your old toilet with a modern-day low-flow model. The new low-flow toilets work just as efficiently as any other kind of toilet, and you'll conserve a surprising amount on your expense.</p>
