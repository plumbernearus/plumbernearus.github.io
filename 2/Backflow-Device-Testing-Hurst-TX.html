<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a strict low salt diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
