When the pressure drops for some reason such as might take place when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to eliminate a fire or a water main breaks or some other circumstance occurs, infected water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an incident, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention technique used.

The proper backflow prevention device is required if an air gap is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Epa and your water provider.</p>
