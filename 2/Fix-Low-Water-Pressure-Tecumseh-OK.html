<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver woman believed the rate she spent for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a few things in a different way could have conserved her a great deal of cash. For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, lower or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will cause a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
