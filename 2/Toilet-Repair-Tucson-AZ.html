<p>A decrease in supply side pressure brought on by an incident such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire battling, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Examine Valve allows the excess client side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge up until the supply side pressure once again exceeds the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this brine goes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent out to drain. This procedure continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain together with the firmness ions) and the bed is considered completely regrowed.</p>
