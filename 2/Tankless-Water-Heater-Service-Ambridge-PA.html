<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be restored (cleaned up). Salt is usually used in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
