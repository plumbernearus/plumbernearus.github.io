<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Downingtown PA</h3>
<p>When buying a new house, it is necessary to guarantee the reliability of your drain and sewer lines. Most plumbing is hidden behind walls and underground. ZOOM DRAIN Â® can perform a comprehensive video inspection of your drainage system using cutting-edge video camera inspection devices specifically designed to spot any problems within your brand-new property's main drain line. Most municipalities and municipalities now require a video inspection of the main drain prior to a house sale can be finished. Our team has the tools and expertise to help you avoid costly repairs in the future.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
