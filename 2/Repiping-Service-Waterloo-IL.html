In the majority of states, other than Kansas, you are accountable for any gas piping on your property from our gas meter to your home or business.

<p>Naturally, it's always simpler to avoid blockages in the very first location. If you have a kitchen garbage disposal, don't overload it. Feed items in a little at a time, and wait until they grind and run through totally prior to including more.

<p>During the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent out to drain. This procedure continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain together with the firmness ions) and the bed is considered fully regrowed.</p>
