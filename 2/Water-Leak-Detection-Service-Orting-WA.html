<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Orting WA</h3>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts down. This is since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however in many cases it need to be much less water.</p>
