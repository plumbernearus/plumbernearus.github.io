<p>The next action for a hopeful plumbing contractor is to earn a contractor's license. Licensed plumbing contractors can own their own plumbing organisation and hire or subcontract work to other licensed plumbers. State licensing requirements for plumbing contractors generally consist of paying an application charge and passing an extensive organisation, law and building regulations test. Some neighborhood colleges and technical schools offer contractor's license preparation and renewal courses. Extra requirements for potential plumbing business owners may consist of proof of financial credibility, insurance coverage and net worth.</p>

<p>If you have a more recent unit, an easy repair or changing specific parts might be all that's required to get your hot water heater working once again. You may be tempted to weld or patch a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to save money. While this may operate in the short term, remember that the weakened pipe is made of the same material as other pipes in your house, implying that problem could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you comfort and prevent bigger leakages down the roadway.</p>
