<p>Lastly, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best used in critical areas where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
