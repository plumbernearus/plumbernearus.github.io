<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The 2 indicators of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate with time, they gradually begin to restrict the flow of water, leading to low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much accumulation to occur, so by the time you observe it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, impacting your water quality.</p>
