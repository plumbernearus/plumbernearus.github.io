<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair costs may be in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800).

<h3>Modern Water Leak Detection Technique in Oneonta NY</h3>
