When the piping in your home begins to reveal any of these signs of deterioration, you will inevitably need to repipe the whole plumbing system. The factor a toilet won't flush might be a low water level in the tank or a clogged inlet. A clog in the trap or drain beneath the toilet can also be the cause.
