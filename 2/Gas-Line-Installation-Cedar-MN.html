<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if needed, to place television back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop if the old discharge tube is too brief. To avoid this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or buy one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
<p>To lower the need of gas line repair, it's important to understand the common causes of gas leakages. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning devices occur most commonly in the winter season. Since homes are not properly aerated during the cooler months to avoid heat loss, this is. If you haven't done so already, we suggest setting up carbon monoxide detectors beyond bedroom doors to inform you of any potential gas leakages.</p>
