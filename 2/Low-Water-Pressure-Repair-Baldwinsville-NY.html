<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow security.

Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually evaluate a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation could occur.
