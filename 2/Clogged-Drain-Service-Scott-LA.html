Handling repairing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the savings incurred from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to press the call a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from moving off the flange).

The flange (and associated gasket, if appropriate) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
