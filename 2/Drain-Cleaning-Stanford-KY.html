A waste disposal unit can lower a home's overall garbage output by crushing most common food scraps so they can be removed through the sink as wastewater. A garbage disposal fits virtually perfectly into the sink, and can be preserved by simply disposing of a couple of ice and some baking soda once a month to sharpen the blades and minimize undesirable odors.</p>
