Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your hot water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your house? If you have any of these issues, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs and even a replacement.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>A newly installed water heater must not produce strange noises, however it will begin to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder over time as the heater runs to warm the water. Things aggravate dramatically for households with a high need for hot water. The factors for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be essential.</p>
