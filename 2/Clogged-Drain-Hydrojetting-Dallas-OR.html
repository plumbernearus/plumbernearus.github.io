<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
