<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the potable water supply and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is required to be set up. An authorized, appropriately installed and kept backflow assembly essentially removes the risk of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capability. Still, the distinction is not enough to make any substantial modifications in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electrical alternative will last about 8-12 years.</p>
