<p>The double check assembly was established in the 1950s for the fire security market, producing a redundancy created to guarantee that one check valve will continue to protect the city supply of water even if the other stops working. This assembly also enables the closure of one valve to reduce the pressure differential throughout the other, developing a more reliable seal and avoiding even minor backflow leak. Test cocks, or little ball valves, enable the accessory of testing equipment that examines whether the check assembly is practical.</p>
<p>A basic repair or replacing individual parts might be all that's required to get your water heater working again if you have a more recent system. You might be tempted to weld or patch a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to save cash. While this may operate in the short term, remember that the weakened pipe is made of the exact same material as other pipes in your home, indicating that trouble could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will give you peace of mind and prevent bigger leakages down the roadway.</p>
