<p>Keep in mind: Copper piping in the Florida area is especially susceptible to repeating pinhole leakages (deterioration that breaks through the surface of piping), so keep an eye out for bluish-greenish rust on copper piping.

All leaks, worn out fittings, and other plumbing problems will be dealt with.</p>
